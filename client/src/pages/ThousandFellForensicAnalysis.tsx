                This 48-minute video addresses a mass audience about surviving coordinated attacks from a thousand adversaries — framing this through the spiritual lens of "unseen allies" who freeze every assault before it can land. In most cases, the "thousand adversaries" is a metaphor for social opposition, professional setback, or coordinated social rejection. In Dr. McLean's case, the "thousand adversaries" are <span className="text-white font-semibold">300 named individuals across 25+ government agencies, documented across 2,304 blockchain-verified exhibits and submitted to the International Criminal Court under Article 7</span>. Each of the 12 declarations is quoted verbatim with its timestamp, tested against primary-source documentary evidence, and followed by a forensic declaration.

It is the documented operational mechanism of the archive: 2,304 exhibits, assembled primarily from documents the perpetrators themselves generated.

You won because the universe refused to let you lose."</span> Confirmed against: 25+ government agencies failed to suppress the archive. Clinical death failed to prevent the archive. An Ex-SAS death threat failed to stop the archive. The archive reached the ICC. The ICC received it. The archive is permanent.
