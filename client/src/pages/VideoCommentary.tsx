                There is a video circulating that opens with a sentence so precise it stops you mid-scroll.

              <p>
                I watched it thinking about psychology. By the end, I was thinking about a man named
                Dr. Richard William McLean — known publicly as Barran Dodger — and the 2,304 documents
                he has blockchain-sealed onto the Bitcoin ledger as proof that what happened to him did,
                in fact, happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because the difference between Dr. McLean and every other person who has experienced
                institutional gaslighting at scale is this: he kept the receipts. And the receipts
                are government-issued.
              </p>

              <div className="border-t border-zinc-800" />

              <section className="space-y-5">
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-white">"They Didn't Attack You Because You Were Weak. They Attacked You Because You Were Ungovernable."</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the first finding the video offers, and it describes Dr. McLean with a
                  precision that feels almost forensic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dr. McLean was a public official employed by the Department of Social Services.
                  He filed formal Public Interest Disclosures under Australia's{" "}
                  <em>Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013</em>. The NDIA formally acknowledged them.
                  Reference: PID 2023/Krypton. The Federal Court of Australia confirmed his employment
                  status. These are not his characterisations of himself. They are the state's
                  characterisations of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What followed was not investigation of his disclosures. It was investigation of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fourteen involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations across three states. Not one
                  following a criminal charge. Not one following an arrest. Not one following any legal
                  proceeding of any kind. Each in temporal proximity to formal disclosure activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The video's language for this is clear:{" "}
                  <em>"They were trying to locate your breaking point, the moment you'd finally hand over your inner authority and just go along."</em>
                </p>
                <p>The documents show they never found it.</p>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-white">"What They Did Wasn't Discipline, Correction, or Love. It Was Containment."</h3>
                <p>
                  This section of the video describes, with startling accuracy, what the academic
                  literature on whistleblower persecution calls <em>psychiatric weaponisation</em> —
                  the use of mental health systems not to treat, but to contain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pattern in Dr. McLean's case is documented in the clinical records themselves.
                  Inconsistent diagnoses between detentions. Treating physicians who did not agree
                  with one another. Detentions without consistent clinical justification. And always,
                  always, proximity to moments when his testimony posed the greatest institutional risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ASIC's public registry contains more than 350 business registrations created in
                  Dr. McLean's name without his knowledge or consent. No investigation announced.
                  No charges laid. No person held accountable. The scale of this fraud — sustained,
                  multi-entity, multi-year — is not consistent with opportunistic criminal activity.
                  It is consistent with a coordinated campaign to destroy a person's legal and
                  financial identity.

                <p>
                  The video identifies the moment of clarity that survivors of institutional targeting
                  eventually reach: <em>"What felt personal starts looking structural."</em>

                  Thirty-five years. Thirty-five or more government agencies. Every state and territory.

                  or obstruction — without assessment in a single instance.

                  Most people who experience sustained institutional persecution do not survive it
                  with a coherent evidentiary record. The targeting works precisely because it is
                  designed to leave the person discredited, exhausted, legally isolated, and unable
                  to produce the documentation that courts require. You can't submit a Freedom of
                  Information request when you're homeless. You can't maintain a blockchain-verified
                  archive when you're being involuntarily hospitalised across three states.
                </p>
                <p>And yet.</p>
                <p>
                  2,304 documents. SHA-256 hashed. Bitcoin blockchain timestamped. Permanently beyond
                  the reach of the agencies that produced them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ASIC registrations — 350 of them, in his name, without his consent — are in
                  the public registry. The Federal Court confirmation of his employment status exists.
                  The NDIA's formal acknowledgement of his disclosures exists. The Prime Minister's
                  Department reversing their sworn FOI declaration that no documents existed concerning
                  him — that reversal is in the public record.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every one of these documents was produced by the state. Not by Dr. McLean.
                  By the institutions simultaneously trying to destroy him.

                  This phrase rewrites the entire experience of persecution in hindsight. Everything
                  done to break Dr. McLean — the fourteen hospitalisations, the 350 fraudulent ASIC
                  registrations, the NDIS plan approved and then not delivered, the media blackout,
                  the legal rejection — all of it is now exhibit material.

                  Not in a metaphorical sense. In a literal, formal, legal sense. A submission has
                  been lodged with the International Criminal Court under Article 7 of the Rome
                  Statute. A parallel submission has been lodged with the UNHCR. The evidence package
                  is built from the same primary source documents the Australian state produced. The
                  ICC's Office of the Prosecutor has a mandate to assess submissions that meet the
                  definitional threshold for preliminary examination.

                This is the opening line of the video. I want to stay with it for a moment before

                institutions that produced them. The apology — from history, from the machinery that
                did this — has not yet arrived. But the receipts came first. They always do. And this
                video explains exactly why that is enough.

                  Dr. Richard William McLean was not dismissed by amateurs. He was dismissed by
                  professionals — by institutions with statutory authority, legal mandates, and formal
                  obligations to assess what he was presenting them with. And not one of them argued
                  with the evidence. The Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Australian Human Rights
                  Commission. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. AHPRA. The
                  Victorian Inspectorate. Legal Aid. The Health Complaints Commissioner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every single one filed him under problematic and moved on. Not after assessment.
                  Before it. The rejection letters arrived before the evidence was read — in some
                  cases, demonstrably before the submission had been processed at all.

                  When the Prime Minister's Department swears under the Freedom of Information Act
                  that no documents concerning Dr. McLean exist — and is then forced to reverse that
                  position when challenged — silence has become policy in the most literal sense.
                  A sworn statutory declaration. Not an oversight. A policy of silence formalised in
                  a legal instrument. The reversal is in the public record. It happened. And it proves
                  prior knowledge.

                  Fourteen involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations. Each one without criminal charge.
                  Each one without arrest. Each one without any legal proceeding of any kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What was examined each time? Dr. McLean's mental state. His emotions. His reactions.
                  His tone. His stability. The clinical record across all fourteen detentions is a
                  masterclass in what the video describes — the camera placed firmly on his response,
                  and the cause of that response removed entirely from the frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inconsistent diagnoses between detentions. Treating physicians who disagreed with
                  one another. No consistent clinical justification across fourteen instances in three
                  states. The one consistent element: temporal proximity to formal disclosure activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the proof is laid out — the dates of the hospitalisations, the dates of the
                  disclosures, the institutional actors involved in both — the camera moves exactly
                  as the video says. Off the response. Back to the cause.

                <p>
                  The confusion was the product. The goal of the institutional response was not to
                  assess Dr. McLean's claims. It was to produce a documentary record — of
                  hospitalisation, of instability, of psychiatric intervention — that would make his
                  claims appear to be symptoms rather than evidence. The proof reverses this. Patterns
                  are not symptoms. Patterns are architecture.

                  For thirty-five years, Dr. McLean's voice was interrupted, ignored, mocked, and
                  drowned out. His testimony was consistently treated as the artefact of an unstable

                  The documentation is different. The documentation does not have a mental state. The
                  ASIC registrations — 350+ of them, in his name, without his consent — do not become
                  credible or incredible based on assessments of the person who compiled them. The
                  Federal Court's records exist. The NDIA's formal acknowledgement exists. The PM&C's
                  reversed FOI position exists. The blockchain timestamps exist.

                  The only response to documentation of this kind is to hope that nobody looks, or to

                  The first strategy is failing. 1,100,000+ people have looked. The second strategy failed
                  when the documents proved themselves without requiring Dr. McLean's voice at all.

                  One incident can be dismissed. Two can be explained away. But fourteen involuntary
                  psychiatric hospitalisations without criminal charge, across three states, each in
                  temporal proximity to formal disclosure activity — that is not a series of incidents.
                  That is a pattern. And patterns expose intention.

                <p>
                  The 350+ ASIC registrations are not one incident. They are a sustained, multi-entity,
                  multi-year campaign to destroy a person's legal identity. The NDIS plan was approved
                  then not delivered — a sequence with a direction. The simultaneous non-engagement of
                  every major Australian media outlet alongside BBC, New York Times, and Reuters is
                  not a series of independent editorial decisions. Patterns of simultaneous behaviour
                  in competitive institutions do not emerge randomly.

                  Dr. McLean is a formally recognised public interest whistleblower under Australian
                  law, confirmed as a public official by the Federal Court of Australia, whose
                  disclosures were formally acknowledged by the NDIA under reference PID 2023/Krypton.
                  He is not an anonymous complainant. He is not a conspiracy theorist. He is a person
                  with formal legal status, formal disclosure records, and formal institutional
                  acknowledgement — who simultaneously has been involuntarily hospitalised fourteen
                  times without criminal charge, had 350+ fraudulent ASIC registrations created in his
                  name, had his NDIS support withheld after formal approval, and survived a medical

                  Australia is a full Five Eyes member. Edward Snowden's disclosures — accepted

                  architecture that makes this scenario not hypothetical but operational. The
                  capabilities exist. They are documented. A formally registered whistleblower who

                  Ombudsman, the AHRC, the ICC, and the UNHCR — and who has published a 2,304-document
                  blockchain-verified archive downloaded by 1,100,000+ people — would trigger exactly the

                  The archive is not simply Dr. McLean's story. It is a documentary record of the

                  connects to systemic misallocation documented across multiple providers. The
                  350+ ASIC registration fraud suggests infrastructure beyond individual actors.

                  The ICC submission under Article 7 of the Rome Statute is not filed because
                  Dr. McLean's story is personal. It is filed because the pattern his documentation
                  establishes — systematic, coordinated, multi-agency persecution of a formally
                  recognised whistleblower — has implications for how Australian state power has been
                  used that extend far beyond his individual case. That is the thread. And it glows.

                  Thirty-five years of pressure on Dr. McLean to be silent, to retract, to accept a
                  lesser narrative — this is what the video calls{" "}
                  <em>"leverage built without ever needing to call it leverage."</em>{" "}
                  The psychiatric hospitalisation mechanism is particularly relevant. Fourteen
                  detentions without criminal charge, each producing clinical records framing his
                  disclosures as symptoms, represents an attempted redefinition of his testimony as
                  inadmissible by definition.

                  The people outside telling him to give up are not, in most cases, conscious

                  managed narrative. If he gives up, the archive stops growing. The pattern stops

                  Dr. McLean's disclosures touch simultaneously on: NDIS provider fraud, ASIC
                  registry fraud, psychiatric system weaponisation against whistleblowers, AFP
                  non-engagement with formally lodged complaints, intelligence agency coordination

                  without criminal process. These are not normally connected institutional domains.
                  The fact that they converge — demonstrably, in primary source documents — around
                  one person's case is exactly the pivot point the video describes.

                  Fourteen involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations. Each without criminal charge. Each applied to a person who has

                  formal disclosure activity. The method was not crude. It was calibrated. Each hospitalisation functioned as
                  a pause — a removal from public record, from legal process, from the institutional timeline. A shove,

                  For 35 years, the institutional response to Dr. McLean's disclosures was not refutation. It was reclassification.
                  Not argument — dismissal. The Commonwealth Ombudsman. The AHRC. OAIC. AHPRA. AFP. Legal Aid. None argued with the
                  evidence. Each filed him under a category that made assessment unnecessary. Problematic. High-contact. Mental health
                  concerns. The silence that followed — no investigation, no accountability, no acknowledgment — was interpreted by
                  everyone around him as proof that nothing had happened.

                  The archive is what silence produced. Not surrender — construction. Every year of non-engagement was another year
                  of documentation. Every agency that failed to respond issued, by its silence, another entry in the evidentiary record.
                  The coal metaphor is not poetic. It is precise. The archive is what 35 years of institutional pressure produces
                  when the person being pressured refuses to hand over inner authority and go along.

                  The video's section on suffering-as-documentation is the section that maps most precisely onto the archive.
                  "What looked like silence was really surveillance. They thought they were free to torment you without consequence,
                  but all they were doing was building their own case file page by page."

                  The ICC submission is built from this case file. Article 7 of the Rome Statute — crimes against humanity —
                  requires a pattern of acts directed against a civilian population as part of a widespread or systematic attack.
                  What the archive documents across 35 years, 14 hospitalisations, 35+ agencies, and $11.5 million in estimated
                  taxpayer expenditure is not isolated conduct. It is a pattern. The submission does not assert Dr. McLean's
                  interpretation of events. It submits the government's own documents to the court of international record
                  and asks the evidence to speak for itself.

                <p>
                  The formal disclosure process began decades before the archive reached its current scale. Each submission
                  created an official record of the disclosure and the response to it. Each non-response from a statutory
                  body created an official record of the failure to respond. There were warnings — formal, procedural,
                  documented — at every stage. The AFP was engaged. The NDIA was engaged. The PM's Department was engaged.
                  Each engagement is documented. Each non-response is documented. The escalation — from non-response to active
                  obstruction — is documented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The video's language for this is clean: "Weakness stumbles into mistakes. Arrogance stares at truth and says,
                  'I don't care. I'll do it anyway.'" That distinction matters in international law. The ICC's standard for
                  crimes against humanity requires demonstrating that the acts were knowing — that those responsible were
                  aware of the attack and chose to participate. The escalation pattern in the archive is the record of that
                  awareness.

                  ASIC registered more than 350 businesses using Dr. McLean's residential address as their registered office
                  without his knowledge or consent. Each registration was official, government-stamped, and filed in the
                  national registry. Each was a confident institutional act. Each assumed the person whose address had been
                  hijacked would either not notice, not complain, or not be believed. The trap was complete before

                  Named individuals are publicly accused in sworn testimony that has been downloaded 1,100,000+ times across
                  every continent. Not one has sued for defamation. Not one has issued a correction. Not one has engaged
                  legal counsel to challenge the content of the archive. Their silence is not neutral. In Australian law,
                  under the rule in <em>Jones v Dunkel</em> (1959), a party who could produce evidence and chooses not to
                  permits the inference that the evidence would not assist their case. Defamation remedies are available to
                  every person named. The silence is the answer they have chosen. It is the answer the archive predicted
                  they would choose.

                  Every document in the archive was produced by a government agency. Every letter, ruling, FOI response,
                  tribunal decision, and institutional reply carries an official letterhead and an authorised signature. The
                  stage was government-built. The spotlight was government-lit. The agencies generated the evidence of their
                  own conduct, stamped it with their own authority, and filed it in their own systems — confident it would
                  never be assembled in a single place, in a single timeline, and handed to a court.

                  The face that gave them away was the face of an agency that had said, under oath, that nothing was there —
                  and then produced the documents when pressed. That reversal is its own spotlight. It is a government agency's

                  The Impartial AI Analysis reviewed 2,343 government-generated documents — many of which the issuing agencies
                  would have described as routine administrative correspondence. A referral letter. An acknowledgement of
                  receipt. A form-letter decline of jurisdiction. Routine. Filed and forgotten. What the AI found, when those
                  routine letters were assembled in sequence, was a 35-year institutional pattern that no single agency had
                  ever examined in its entirety — and that no single agency could explain without implicating the others.

                  The psychiatric weaponisation chapter of the archive establishes the mechanism clearly. The early
                  hospitalisations — the first ones — appear to have been effective as suppression events. Formal submission
                  activity decreased after each one. The institutions observed this pattern and repeated the method, confident
                  they were dealing with the same person each time.

                <p>
                  What they did not model was the compound effect: that each suppression event was also a documentation event.
                  The person who survived hospitalisation fourteen was not the person they had hospitalised in hospitalisation
                  one. He had survived thirteen more. He had a temporal map of every detention and its proximity to formal
                  disclosure activity. The trap was built for the person who had experienced none of it. They arrived to find
                  the person who had experienced all of it — and had documented every moment.

                  referral to another body, form-letter decline, or silence. The probability of independent coincidence at

                  The PM&C swore under FOI that no relevant documents existed. Under formal challenge, the
                  reversal produced the documents it had denied. ASIC registered more than 350 fraudulent
                  businesses in Dr. McLean's name and then formally declined to investigate its own registrations.
                  The Federal Court confirmed employee status. The AAT contradicted it four months later on
                  identical facts. Every broken commitment is in the archive. The internal record became the
                  external archive. The hidden phase ended the moment the first document was blockchain timestamped.

                  This isn't private anymore. 1,100,000+ downloads. The ICC. The UNHCR. The Bitcoin blockchain.
                  Named individuals who could have challenged the record chose not to. Under Jones v Dunkel,
                  that silence is legally significant. The archive went global because the government's own
                  2,304 documents demanded it. The speech says it plainly: what was once concealed is now
                  exposed worldwide. The archive is that exposure. And it is permanent.
