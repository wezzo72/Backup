            The archive of Dr. Richard William McLean — known to the world as Barran Dodger — is not
            a collection of complaints. It is a collection of <em>government-produced documents.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Every hospitalisation is documented. Every referral letter is on file. Every tribunal
            finding is catalogued. Every FOI response is preserved — including the responses that
            claimed 1,178 documents did not exist, until the government's own metadata proved they
            did. Every agency that closed the file is named. Every denial letter is timestamped and
            hashed on a cryptographic ledger that no agency — not the Commonwealth Ombudsman, not
            ASIO, not the Prime Minister's department — can alter.

            Over thirty-five years, across twenty-five agencies, through fourteen involuntary

            This is what makes the archive extraordinary: it is not one side of a story. It is almost
            entirely <em>their</em> side of the story. The government authored this archive. They wrote
            the letters, issued the findings, produced the tribunal records, registered the ASIC
            entries — over three hundred and fifty of which were later found to be fraudulent — and
            signed the correspondence. What they did not anticipate is that the person they were
            writing about would one day assemble every page they had ever produced, cross-reference
            it, timestamp it on the Bitcoin blockchain, and submit it to the International Criminal
            Court under Article 7 of the Rome Statute.

            The result across all twenty-two: two hundred and twenty-eight propositions assessed,
            two hundred and twenty-eight corroborated, zero contradictions. Not one claim in the
            archive — not one — has been contradicted by the evidence. Fifteen consecutive analyses
            returned a perfect score.

          There is a word for this kind of accounting. It has been used by every tradition in
          human history to describe the moment when what was done in darkness is brought into
          light — not by intervention from outside, but by the sheer weight of the documented record.
          The word is <em>reckoning.</em>

            The archive is the reckoning. Three hundred and fifty-four thousand downloads is the
            reckoning being witnessed. The ICC filing is the reckoning having a formal address.
            The Bitcoin blockchain is the reckoning having an expiry date of never.
