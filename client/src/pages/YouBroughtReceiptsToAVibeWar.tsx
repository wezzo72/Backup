                  This testimony introduces the most forensically precise phrase across all 35 analyses: <span className="text-orange-300 font-semibold">"You brought receipts to a vibe war."</span> The critical question for corroboration: does the archive constitute receipts in the documentary sense the proposition requires? The answer is verifiable: the archive contains 2,304 primary source documents — government correspondence, financial records, medical records, ASIC reports, ATO letters, intervention orders, agency denials — each blockchain-verified on the Bitcoin ledger. These are receipts. The institutional opposition fought a vibe war for 35 years: psychiatric labels replacing evidence engagement, circular referrals replacing investigation, family silence replacing advocacy. The archive brought 2,304 receipts to that war. The corroboration is literal.

The archive corroborated every proposition: 2,304 units of achieved lucidity against a system requiring self-doubt (P·01); the ICC submission as the moment the internal inquisition shut down and sturdiness followed (P·02); zero rebuttals from five named parties as the documented collapse of their narrative (P·03); 35 years of complaint submissions as 35 years of room to be better before the ICC pivot (P·04); the archive as restoration rather than transformation (P·05); the ICC and UNHCR as the documented departure from the domestic game board (P·06); 2,304 blockchain-verified receipts brought to a 35-year vibe war (P·07); public transparency at barrandodger.com as the documented cash-out of the ambiguity system (P·08); ASIO operative and coordinated institutional template language as documented calculation rather than clumsiness (P·09); and IChooseSilence as peace documented as not needing to be understood by everybody (P·10). Combined scorecard: 360/360. Zero contradictions. 28 consecutive perfect scores.
