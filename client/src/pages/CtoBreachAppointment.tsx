    summary: "A Community Treatment Order (CTO) authorises compulsory community-based psychiatric treatment. Section 50 empowers the Mental Health Review Tribunal or a Magistrate to make a CTO. Section 68 specifies what constitutes a breach. A CTO can require a person to attend appointments, take medications, and reside at a specified address — all backed by the power of detention if breached. The Act contains no explicit prohibition on its use against a person making simultaneous formal complaints about the mental health system itself — a structural gap exploited in politically targeted cases.",

    summary: "Section 68 provides that if a person subject to a CTO breaches the order's conditions, a mental health clinician may take the person into custody and bring them before a Magistrate or the Mental Health Review Tribunal. This creates a mechanism by which a person with a documented history of legitimate complaints about institutional persecution — a 'political target' — can be forcibly hospitalised based not on clinical deterioration but on a clinician's assessment that they have 'breached' conditions. The use of this power against a whistleblower making simultaneous submissions to the ICC, UNHCR, and Federal Court is directly relevant to the question of whether the mental health system is being weaponised.",

            <p>
              The CTO Breach Appointment document published here is primary-source evidence of the most intimate mechanism by which the mental health system in Australia has been deployed as an instrument of political targeting against Dr. Richard William McLean. A Community Treatment Order compels a person to attend medical appointments, take prescribed medications, and comply with specified conditions — all backed by the threat of forced psychiatric hospitalisation if the order is breached. It is, in effect, a form of legally sanctioned coercive control over a person's body, movements, and time — issued not by a court in adversarial proceedings but by a clinical authority whose assessment is not independently verifiable in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The forensic significance of this document lies in its timing and context. On April 15, 2026, Dr. McLean reported a credible death threat to AbleCare — his NDIS-funded housing provider. Police attended and deliberately withheld the incident number. AbleCare CEO Rachel terminated the recorded call without filing a police report or SIRS (Serious Incident Response Scheme) report. Dr. McLean sent written notice to Brett Butler (AbleCare support worker) stating that AbleCare would be complicit in his murder if it did not act. None of these communications prompted any protective action. Into this vacuum — in which law enforcement declined to protect a person from a documented murder threat — the mental health compliance apparatus remained operative, requiring Dr. McLean's attendance at a CTO appointment. The asymmetry is the evidence: the state will not protect him from death, but it will compel him to attend a psychiatric appointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This pattern is consistent with the internationally documented phenomenon of mental health weaponisation against dissidents, whistleblowers, and human rights defenders. In the Soviet Union it was called 'psikhushka' — the use of psychiatric diagnosis to suppress political opposition. In Australia, it does not require a conspiracy; it requires only a system in which psychiatric assessors are not independent of the institutions against which a person is complaining, and in which the clinical record of a 35-year whistleblower is written, in part, by the very system they are exposing. The presence of this CTO Breach Appointment in the archive — alongside 2,304 other documents, 845 blockchain timestamp seals, and submissions to the ICC, UNHCR, and Federal Court — means it cannot be dismissed as an isolated clinical event. It is the latest chapter in a 35-year documented sequence.

                The recorded phone call to AbleCare CEO Rachel and support worker Brett on April 15, 2026 — in which the death threat was reported, a duty of care was acknowledged and then abandoned, and a request for emergency relocation was met with "days or weeks" — is the primary companion exhibit to this CTO Breach Appointment document. Taken together, these two documents define the operational architecture of the targeting: compulsory mental health compliance enforced against the same person whose physical safety was deliberately ignored by law enforcement and abandoned by an NDIS provider. The call is transcribed, forensically annotated, and published in full on this site.

            <p>
              Dr. Richard William McLean formally places on public record — through publication of this document and this analysis — his challenge to the legitimacy of any CTO compliance requirement issued against him while:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 text-zinc-400">
              <li>He was under a credible, documented death threat from an identified individual (Tory Kilborn) and associated persons;</li>
              <li>NSW Police attended his premises and deliberately withheld an incident report — removing the threat from official records;</li>
              <li>AbleCare CEO Rachel acknowledged a legal duty of care on a recorded call, then terminated the call without action;</li>
              <li>No mandatory SIRS incident report was filed by AbleCare within the required 24-hour window;</li>
              <li>His access to legal representation before the Mental Health Review Tribunal was obstructed by the Public Guardian — an office identified in his documentary archive as a key actor in coordinated financial abuse;</li>
              <li>His primary submissions documenting 35 years of institutional persecution were before the International Criminal Court under Article 7 (Crimes Against Humanity) and before the UNHCR (Geneva).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The engagement of compulsory mental health compliance mechanisms in these circumstances — without any of the above facts being placed before the assessing clinician or the Mental Health Review Tribunal — represents a failure of procedural fairness that is independently reviewable under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW), the NDIS Act 2013 (Cth), the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), the CRPD, and the ICCPR.
