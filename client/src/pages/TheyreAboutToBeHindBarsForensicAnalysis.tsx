                This video addresses four universal experiences — divine justice, trauma-forged insight,
                coordinated suppression, and being perceived by a hostile world — using the language of
                motivation and spiritual declaration. When cross-examined against the documented case of
                Dr. Richard McLean, each framework resolves from metaphor into primary-source evidentiary
                confirmation. The "300K+ slow-down system" describes 300+ named perpetrators across 25+
                government agencies. The "heaven's courtroom stamping" describes 2,304 blockchain-verified
                exhibits. The "warrant needing to be airtight" describes an ICC submission against which
                zero defamation proceedings have been filed. The "prison of self-blame" describes 14
                involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations designed to manufacture doubt about documented
                reality. <strong className="text-red-300">12 declarations extracted. 12 verified.
