                <span className="font-bold text-body-text">Methodology Note:</span> All cost estimates in this analysis are derived from publicly available 
                government data sources including AIHW health expenditure reports, APSC remuneration data, ANAO performance audits, 
                state health department fee schedules, AFP annual reports, ASIO annual reports, NDIS quarterly reports, OAIC FOI cost 
                recovery guidelines, and published tribunal hearing costs. Where exact costs are not publicly available (e.g., ASIO 
                surveillance operations), conservative estimates are extrapolated from published operational budgets and private sector 
                benchmarks. All source citations are provided for independent verification. This analysis represents a conservative 
                lower-bound estimate — actual costs are likely significantly higher.
