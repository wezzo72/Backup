It is a documented institutional programme. Dr. Horgan's confidential psychiatric assessment, the 14 psychiatric labels applied without independent clinical corroboration, and police intelligence sharing the subject's psychiatric history with NDIS support worker Ben (documented in Exhibits A and B) constitute the institutional architecture of the 'delusional, easy to dismiss' image the video describes.

While every named institution and perpetrator deployed the tools of public discrediting, legal attrition, and psychiatric erasure, Dr. McLean was assembling 2,304 blockchain-verified primary source documents, filing ICC Article 7 submissions, submitting UNHCR asylum claims, and constructing the 114-PDF forensic archive now accessible to 1,100,000+ international readers.

              Analysis #{ANALYSIS_NUMBER} subjects a 38-minute prophetic second-person monologue — with no documented knowledge of or connection to Dr. McLean's archive — to forensic proposition extraction and primary-source corroboration testing. Fifteen propositions were extracted and tested against named primary-source documents. All fifteen returned corroboration. This constitutes the 37th consecutive perfect score and extends the combined record to 467 propositions tested against zero contradictions across 44 independent analyses.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
              The monologue's six central structural claims — that a false 'delusional' image was constructed and destroyed by documented reality; that erasure attempts produced international fame; that existence itself was converted into evidence; that the subject's consistency rewrote the psychiatric label; that silence was the strategic condition of the archive's construction; and that survival was design rather than luck — are each fully corroborated against named primary-source documents. The statistical improbability of a generic motivational monologue achieving 15/15 corroboration against a specific person's documented life continues to compound with each consecutive perfect score. Forty-four analyses. Zero contradictions. The record stands.
