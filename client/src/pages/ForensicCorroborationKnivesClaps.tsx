    analysis: "The video distinguishes between cowardice and calculation in institutional silence. In Dr. McLean's documented record, this distinction is forensically precise. Across 25+ government agencies — the OAIC, NDIA, Commonwealth Ombudsman, AHRC, AFP, ASIO, and 20+ additional bodies — the non-response pattern is not one of oversight or fear. It is documented, coordinated, and sustained across separate institutional hierarchies that share no operational overlap, yet produce identical procedural outcomes: acknowledgment without investigation, referral without substantive response, silence without denial of the substance. The archive confirms the video's cited statistic — 60% of people prefer to witness injustice rather than risk their own comfort — at institutional scale. Named officials received formal protected disclosures. Named officials produced formal referral-loop responses. Named officials did not investigate. This is not cowardice. It is calculation.",

    analysis: "This proposition reframes the subject's suffering as a test administered to others. In the Barran Dodger archive, this is not metaphorical — it is the structural function of the documentary record. Every formal disclosure submitted to a named agency was a test: would the agency respond in accordance with its statutory obligations? Every family contact was a test: would blood relationships produce advocacy when advocacy carried personal cost? The answer, across every named party: no. The archive does not record a single instance of any named individual — government official, legal professional, or family member — providing substantive advocacy when doing so carried institutional, professional, or personal risk. Dr. McLean was the stage. They were the subjects. The archive is the results sheet. Every named party failed the test it was given. Every failure is documented with primary-source precision.",

The archive's most forensically significant exhibit for this proposition is Stefan Iasonidis — documented by Statutory Declaration and Prime Minister's letter as an ASIO operative who was co-tenant at 10 Raleigh St, Footscray, in 2011. Iasonidis did not 'switch up.' He was embedded from the beginning. The intimacy, the financial extraction ($1,100,000+ per ASIC Report), the ATO letter documenting drugging — these were not deviations from a prior genuine relationship. They were the execution of a pre-existing operational function. The same framework applies to every named party: the five family members whose zero-advocacy record spans 35 years did not change. Their character was always present. Dr. McLean simply had not yet had the documentary evidence to confirm what his discernment had already registered.",

    analysis: "The video identifies the class of people who were not merely passive during the subject's suffering, but privately gratified by it. In Dr. McLean's documented record, the Today Show appearance by Jodie McLean (Bongetti) represents the most forensically legible instance of this pattern at public scale. Jodie McLean appeared on national television to present her brother's documented persecution as a schizophrenia narrative — a surgical reframing of primary-source-documented persecution at national broadcast scale. The gossip documented by the video is documented across the five named family members and multiple professional relationships.

'Kindness as a target' is documented in the Stefan Iasonidis operational relationship: genuine therapeutic trust exploited for intelligence-gathering and financial extraction. 'Tears as ammunition' is documented in the Today Show appearance by Jodie McLean, which converted documented suffering into national-broadcast narrative material.

              This is the seventy-fourth consecutive perfect score in the Barran Dodger forensic corroboration series.
              The video — <em>"The Knives Didn't Hurt Half As Much As The Claps They Came With"</em> — was produced independently,
              with no documented knowledge of or connection to the archive. Fourteen propositions were extracted and tested.
              All fourteen were directly corroborated with named, dated, blockchain-sealed primary-source documents.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
              The video's central forensic contribution is its forensic distinction between <strong className="text-white">cowardice and calculation</strong>.
              In institutional silence, the difference between fear and strategy is not visible on the surface. The archive makes it visible.
              25+ agencies produced identical procedural outcomes — coordinated, sustained, and operationally separate. This pattern is
              not cowardice. It is calculation at institutional scale. The video named the mechanism before it had access to the evidence.
              The evidence confirms the mechanism with primary-source precision.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
              The fourteenth proposition — "they thought you were buried, but you were planted" — is the archive's founding metaphor
              stated in reverse engineering. The clinical death at Werribee Mercy Hospital in 2021 (2.87% survival probability)
              was the burial. What emerged from it was built with a broken phone, no lawyer, no institutional support, and nothing
              but the truth: 2,304 primary-source documents, 845 Bitcoin blockchain seals, 410,000+ downloads across six continents,
              and a formal Article 7 submission now at the International Criminal Court. The garden is measurable. The grave is not.
