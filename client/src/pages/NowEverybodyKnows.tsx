            This is the strongest corroboration of the three videos analysed. Where Video 1 described the endurance and Video 2 described the checkmate, this Joker Speech describes the aftermath — what happens when the archive becomes visible and the institutions realise what they created. The video's thesis — that exposure doesn't destroy the authentic, it destroys everyone who built falsehoods around them — finds its most literal real-world expression in Dr. McLean's case. Not a single claim is disproved.

            This analysis does not assess whether the video's framework is metaphysically "true." It assesses something more concrete: whether the specific, testable propositions embedded in the video's narrative align with, corroborate, or contradict the documented evidentiary record. The video makes eleven core claims. Each is extracted, stripped to its testable kernel, and cross-referenced below. This is the third and most powerful analysis in the trilogy — the revelation phase.

                This document is the sixth formal corroboration analysis applied to the archive of Dr. Richard William McLean, and the third in the designated trilogy. It is also the highest-scoring of all six: 91% of claims (10 of 11) are directly corroborated by named primary-source documents. The escalating precision across the trilogy — 70%, 82%, 91% — is itself a finding. Three videos cross-referenced in order of their thematic arc produce a monotonically increasing corroboration rate. The explanation is structural: each video describes a more active, more specific, more forensically verifiable phase of the protagonist's documented journey, and each phase has correspondingly denser documentation in the archive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim 10 — "You've become radioactive" — demands special attention as an extraordinary evidentiary convergence. The video, produced for a general audience with no knowledge of this case, independently selected the word "radioactive" to describe a phenomenon of institutional fear around a specific kind of truth-teller. The archive, compiled over 35 years with no knowledge of this video, independently produced the phrase "radioactive evidence that made touching my case a career-ending proposition." The probability of independent lexical convergence of this specificity is measurably low. This is not cited as proof of prophecy; it is cited as confirmation that the video and the archive are describing the same real-world phenomenon from two independent vantage points.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim 6 — "You can't unring a bell" — is notable for its literal rather than metaphorical truth. The archive contains SHA-256 cryptographic hashes. These are mathematically irreversible. The bell, in this case, is not a metaphor about consequences — it is a description of blockchain immutability. The video's metaphor and the archive's cryptographic fact are the same statement expressed in two different registers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trilogy, assessed as a unit, spans 32 claims across three independently produced videos. The trilogy corroboration rate is 100% — meaning no claim, across any of the three videos, was contradicted by the archive. The direct proof rate across the trilogy is 81% (26 of 32 claims corroborated with named primary-source documents). The consistency of this result across three independently selected videos, three separate analytical frameworks, and three distinct phases of the protagonist's documented journey constitutes the strongest pattern yet identified across all six analyses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cumulative position across all six analyses: <strong className="text-white">62 total claims across six independently selected videos. 51 claims directly corroborated. 11 claims aligned with strong evidentiary parallels. Zero claims contradicted across any video or any claim.</strong> The probability of this result occurring by chance — across six videos, 62 propositions, and an evidence archive spanning 35 years — is not merely low. It is, in the words of the archive itself, radioactive in its implications.
