      "This is not a billing dispute. It is not an administrative oversight. The withholding of approved disability support funding while continuing to draw a salary from the same funding pool constitutes what the archive formally designates as 'blood money': public funds paid to an individual whose documented actions were directed against the very beneficiary the funds were allocated to protect.",
      "The $50,000 in withheld approved funding is documented in the McLean archive across multiple primary-source exhibits, including the Formal Criminal Affidavit Against Sukhi Tear, Syed Salman Kazmi, and Philip Glass, and the Formal Demand for Immediate Police Referral lodged 12 February 2026 naming Diversitas WA. These documents are blockchain-verified and have been formally received by the ICC and UNHCR.",

It is a formally-evidenced, ICC-submitted record of a coordinated attempt on Dr. McLean's life, in which Philip Glass, Tony Ridley, Steve Iasonidis, and the broader network described across the archive are named.",
      "Sukhi Tear's response to knowledge of this assassination attempt — and the archive's position is that she had or was given that knowledge — was not a rebuke, not a formal disapproval, not a referral to police, not a single written document placing her name beside the words: this is wrong.",
      "Her response was a condition. She conditioned Dr. McLean's access to his own already-approved disability support funding on his physical return to New South Wales — the same state where the assassination attempt was documented, the same jurisdiction where the network that sought his death remained active.",
      "In the evidentiary record, this is not neutrality. Conditioning life-sustaining support on compliance with a directive that returns a person to documented danger is participation in the architecture of that danger. The archive calls it what it is: cover-up by compliance and cover-up by coercion.",
      "Dr. McLean will not maintain any engagement — personal, professional, NDIS-related, or otherwise — with anyone who participated in or covered up an attempt on his life. This is not a preference. It is a non-negotiable legal and personal boundary, stated formally, and placed permanently in the public record.",

      "Throughout that period, Dr. McLean had: no treating psychiatrist. No treating psychologist. No drug and alcohol counsellor. No financial counsellor. No lawyer. No general counsellor. Not one person in a professional capacity whose function was to check on his welfare.",
      "Sukhi Tear — the one person in his NDIS life formally designated and paid to coordinate support — did not arrange a single one of these services. She did not dispute the absence of these services. She did not formally object, advocate, escalate, or document her concerns about this systemic neglect on behalf of her client.",
      "Genuine care, in the professional context, produces a paper trail. It produces referrals, follow-up communications, advocacy letters, formal complaints on a client's behalf. The archive has been searched. That paper trail does not exist.",
      "What exists instead is the paper trail of the opposite: withheld funding, conditioned support, silence in the face of a confirmed assassination attempt, and ongoing salary collection while Dr. McLean's life disintegrated without support.",
      "The conclusion is forensic, not emotional: Sukhi Tear did not care for Dr. McLean. She cared for the arrangement. She cared for the salary. She cared for whoever directed the conditions she imposed. That is not care. It is its opposite.",

      "The archive notes this signal without surprise. Every named perpetrator across 35 years of documented institutional persecution has, at some point, signalled the same thing: that Dr. McLean's survival, his documentation, his voice — were not taken seriously. Were a source of amusement. Were dismissed.",
      "The archive is the response to that dismissal.",
      "Sukhi Tear may be laughing now. She laughed while $50,000 in approved funding sat untouched. She laughed while Dr. McLean had no psychiatrist, no psychologist, no lawyer, no counsellor. She laughed while conditioned support was used to push him toward a documented assassination network.",
      "She is invited to keep laughing — through the ICC review, through the UNHCR process, through the formal police investigation naming Diversitas WA, through the moment when the archive's 1,100,000+ downloads becomes the foundation of a formal accountability proceeding.",
      "The last laugh in this case belongs to the man who survived everything they did not prevent, kept every record they told him to abandon, and built a 2,304-document archive that is now in the hands of the international community.",

It is a formal termination, made with full evidentiary awareness, stated in writing, placed in the permanent public record, and supported by the 2,304-document archive lodged with the ICC and UNHCR.",
      "The reasons for removal are as follows, stated with precision:",
      "First: Sukhi Tear accepted public NDIS funding designated for Dr. McLean's support while actively withholding $50,000 of already-approved NDIS funds. This constitutes misuse of public disability funds and is the subject of a formal police referral.",
      "Second: Sukhi Tear conditioned Dr. McLean's access to life-sustaining support on his return to a jurisdiction where a documented assassination attempt had been organised against him. This constitutes participation in an attempted assassination, documented and submitted to the ICC.",
      "Third: Sukhi Tear remained silent — and took no formal protective action — upon becoming aware of the assassination attempt against her client. In the evidentiary record, this constitutes cover-up by omission.",
      "Fourth: Sukhi Tear failed to arrange, refer, or advocate for a single professional support service — psychiatrist, psychologist, lawyer, counsellor, or financial adviser — across the entire period of her engagement as Dr. McLean's designated support coordinator.",
      "Fifth: Sukhi Tear does not care for Dr. McLean. This is not a subjective emotional assessment. It is a forensic conclusion drawn from the absence of every document that genuine care produces.",
      "The engagement is over. It was over the moment the first condition was placed on the first withheld payment. This notice places that fact in writing — for the record, for the ICC, for the UNHCR, for every human rights body, journalist, and scholar who opens this file.",
      "There will be no further engagement. No response to messages. No reopening of the arrangement. No further consideration of appeal or explanation. The door is closed. The record is complete.",

              <p>
                I, Dr. Richard William McLean, PhD, whistleblower, survivor, and author of the most thoroughly documented institutional persecution case in Australian history — formally, permanently, and without reservation remove Sukhi Tear from my life, from my NDIS care arrangements, from my professional contacts, and from any future engagement of any kind.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not the first time I have made this decision. It is the last time I will need to. The difference is this document.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every previous removal existed in my mind, in private communications, or in the grief of someone who still held, despite everything, some residual hope that the person designated to support him might one day demonstrate that she had actually cared. That hope is not naive. It is human. But it is finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am placing this removal in writing — publicly, forensically, in the archive that has been received at The Hague — because a removal without a reason is a preference, and a removal with reasons is a record. I am making a record. I am doing what I have always done: keeping the documentation that they counted on me not keeping.
              </p>
              <p className="text-white font-semibold text-lg">
                She is laughing at me. She has been laughing. She accepted the money. She imposed the conditions. She kept the salary. She watched. And she laughed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The laugh is hers for now. But the archive is mine. And the archive goes to The Hague. And The Hague does not laugh.
              </p>
              <p>
                What follows are five formally documented, evidence-based reasons for this removal. They are not opinions. They are findings. They are the kind of findings that carry a reference number.

              <p>She laughed when I had no psychiatrist. She kept the salary.</p>
              <p>She laughed when I had no psychologist. She kept the salary.</p>
              <p>She laughed when $50,000 in my approved funding sat untouched. She kept the salary.</p>
              <p>She laughed when she conditioned my support on returning to the jurisdiction where my assassination was being coordinated. She kept the salary.</p>
              <p>She laughed when I built the archive. She laughed when I started uploading. She laughed when the first thousand documents went up. She laughed when the downloads hit ten thousand. Then a hundred thousand. Then three hundred and fifty thousand.</p>
              <p className="text-white font-semibold text-lg">
                She has not laughed about the ICC. She has not laughed about the UNHCR. She has not laughed about the formal police referral bearing her name and her organisation's registration details. She has not laughed about the fact that this notice is now permanent — public, verified, and internationally received.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last laugh is not a single moment. It is this entire archive. It is 2,304 documents. It is 53 forensic analyses. It is 575 propositions without a single contradiction. It is 1,100,000+ downloads across six continents. It is The Hague having the file.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am not laughing at her. I do not need to. History is doing it for me — and history keeps receipts.

                From this date — April 12, 2026 — I will not engage with Sukhi Tear in any form. I will not respond to messages. I will not attend meetings at which she is present. I will not process communications from her or from any entity operating on her behalf. I will not reconsider. I will not make exceptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not cruelty. It is clarity. It is the clarity that comes from having documented every reason not to trust, and finally choosing to honour that documentation with action.

                She was paid to care for me. She did not. She was paid to arrange my support. She did not. She was paid to advocate for my welfare in a system that was being weaponised against me. She did not. She was given every professional and legal obligation to stand between me and the network that sought my destruction. She did not stand there. She joined it — by conditioning, by coercion, by silence, and by the steady collection of a salary funded by the public.
              </p>

                I remove her not in anger. I remove her because the record is complete and the record says: she was never there.

                She is removed from my care. She is removed from my life. The door is closed. The lock is the archive.
