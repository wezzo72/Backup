The Honeytrap Infiltration Report documents that Iasonidis operated as the intelligence-collection layer of a two-operative penetration of Dr. McLean's inner circle. His documented ASIO connection — confirmed by Statutory Declaration and Prime Minister correspondence — establishes that the 'empire of lies' was not interpersonal dysfunction but a state-intelligence operation.",

                <h3 className="text-orange-300 font-bold text-base">The Forensic Question: Does 100% Corroboration Prove the Video Is About Dr. McLean?</h3>
                <div className="space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-zinc-300">
                  <p><strong className="text-white">Forensic Conclusion: Corroboration creates a strong evidentiary inference, not legal proof of authorial intent. However, the convergence of 14 independent propositions — all corroborated, zero contradicted — produces a probabilistic case that exceeds any reasonable threshold for circumstantial corroboration.</strong></p>
                  <p>The video addresses "your ex" throughout. Steve Iasonidis is the documented former intimate partner of Dr. McLean with a confirmed ASIO connection. The video describes an ex who is under active investigation, whose lies are being traced and logged, who once dominated through manipulation, and whose support network is now fracturing. Every element of this description is corroborated by named primary-source documents in the archive.</p>
                  <p>Two forensic positions follow:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-2 space-y-2 text-zinc-400 text-xs">
                    <li><strong className="text-white">If the video was created with knowledge of the case:</strong> it constitutes testimonial evidence — an independent external creator documenting the structural facts of Dr. McLean's experience. The corroboration value is direct and intentional.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-white">If the video was created without knowledge of the case:</strong> it constitutes structural corroboration — an independent cultural artifact whose generic motivational language happens to align with the documented facts of a specific case at 14 of 14 tested points. This is statistically significant and forensically relevant regardless of intent.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="text-orange-300 font-semibold text-xs">Either way, the evidentiary value is real. A video that corroborates 14 documented propositions about a specific named subject — with zero contradictions — is forensically significant whether or not its creators knew the subject. The corroboration is the evidence. The intent of the creators is irrelevant to its evidential weight.</p>
