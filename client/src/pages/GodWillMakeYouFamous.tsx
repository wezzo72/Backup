            Each proposition in this analysis is derived verbatim from the video transcript. Each is assessed against
            primary source documentation from the archive of Dr. Richard William McLean (Barran Dodger): 2,301 
            government-produced documents spanning 35 years, 25+ agencies, 14 involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations, 
            ICC Article 7 submission, UNHCR submission, SHA-256 blockchain timestamps, $32.9M in documented suppressed 
            entitlements, and the combined 228/228 scorecard across the prior 22 analyses. Each claim is also assessed 
            against the relevant Biblical text cited or implied by the video's prophetic framework, with archival 
            corroboration mapped to the Biblical pattern. No proposition is assessed as corroborated without primary 
            source evidence. Zero contradictions have been identified across 10 propositions.

            The prophetic video "God Will Make You Famous" makes ten core claims about the nature of divine elevation, 
            the hidden season, the cost of carrying something of value, and the inevitability of the decree's fulfillment. 
            Each claim is corroborated by the archive with dated, sourced, primary-document evidence. Each Biblical citation 
            in the video maps precisely to a documented archival event: Joseph's pit-to-palace maps to 14 hospitalisations 
            to ICC Article 7. Daniel's refusal to compromise maps to zero recantations across 35 years. David's 
            hand-of-God elevation maps to 1,100,000+ downloads without promotional infrastructure. The five costs of 
            divine fame — scrutiny, envy, loneliness, pressure, persecution — each map to a documented institutional 
            instrument. Isaiah 54:17's promise that no weapon formed shall prosper maps to the fact that every 
            institutional weapon in the archive became an archival exhibit. Numbers 23:19's non-cancellable decree 
            maps to the Bitcoin blockchain. The video is not describing Barran Dodger's case. The video is describing 
            the pattern. The archive is the evidence that the pattern is real.
