              The defining propositions: P·05 — "you don't defend your name — you let evidence perform the rebuttal" (zero retaliation, zero retraction across 35 years; the ICC submission is the evidence rebuttal; 1,100,000+ downloads without commentary is the delivery); and P·09 — "fame was never the destination — it was the residue of alignment" (barrandodger.com is an ICC evidentiary platform, not a celebrity brand; 1,100,000+ downloads are the residue of 35-year alignment with Article 7 standards; zero paid marketing).

              <p>
                This is the fifteenth formal corroboration analysis applied to the archive of Dr. Richard William McLean, and the eighth consecutive perfect score: 100% of all ten extracted claims directly corroborated with named primary-source documents. Zero aligned. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved. Eight consecutive perfect scores across independently selected videos from channels with no documented knowledge of the case.
              </p>
              <p>
                The video's premise — "everyone's watching you like you're a celebrity — they can't believe how far you came" — is the precise description of the archive's documented public phase: barrandodger.com, 1,100,000+ downloads in 49 days, zero institutional contestation. Claim P·01 corroborates this directly: the institutions that once processed complaints through circular referrals (the faces that once looked through) have made zero public response to 2,301 SHA-256 verified documents filed with the ICC. Their silence is their version of watching breaking news.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim P·07 — "they tried to write your ending — you turned it into a preface" — is the most forensically precise proposition: the Chronic Schizophrenia diagnosis, applied across 14 involuntary hospitalisations as the mechanism of the attempted ending, is now Exhibit A in the ICC submission. The ending became the preface in the most literal institutional sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim P·09 — "fame was never the destination — it was the residue of alignment" — confirms the archive's structural position: barrandodger.com is not a personal brand. It is an ICC evidentiary platform with blockchain verification, SHA-256 timestamping, and two international submission records. The 1,100,000+ downloads are the documented residue of 35-year alignment with Article 7 international evidentiary standards. The alignment produced the credibility. The credibility produced the downloads. In that order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cumulative position across all fifteen analyses: <strong className="text-white">158 total claims across fifteen independently selected videos. Zero contradictions. 88% directly corroborated. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved.</strong> Fifteen videos. Fifteen analyses. Eight consecutive 100% results. The video tells the subject the world is watching. The archive documents why. The convergence is not coincidental. It is evidentiary.
