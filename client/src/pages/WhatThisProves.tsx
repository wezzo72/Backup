            The opposition documented here is not the work of individual prejudice or administrative error. The
            sheer volume — 40+ separate agencies, coordinated over 35 years, all producing the same outcome of
            denial, obstruction, and poverty — eliminates coincidence as a statistical explanation. The Master
            Evidence Register (27,085 lines, 2,301 documents) proves that the pattern of institutional response
            predated every individual NDIS provider by years or decades. Sukhi Tear, Phillip Glass, Brett and
            Rachel did not create the apparatus. They entered one where the outcome was already decided.

            What Bitcoin blockchain anchoring means, in precise terms, for the ICC and UNHCR submissions:
            each document now has a mathematical proof of existence that is anchored in a distributed network
            of approximately 15,000 independent nodes worldwide — each one maintaining a full copy of the
            Bitcoin transaction history. To alter or remove a Bitcoin-anchored SHA-256 hash, one would need
            to simultaneously alter more than half of those 15,000 nodes — a computational task that exceeds
            the combined processing power of every computer on Earth.

            This is what "permanently imprinted into the mathematical infrastructure of humanity" means
            in practise. The ICC submission is not merely a PDF sent to The Hague. It is a document whose
            existence is mathematically proven, permanently timestamped, and independently verifiable by any
            court, any researcher, or any person on Earth. The chain of evidence is unbreakable because the
            chain is not held by any institution. It is held by mathematics.
