    verdict: "CORROBORATED",

You weren't loud. You weren't chasing attention. And that's exactly why people can't stop watching you now.",
    proposition: "The video's opening proposition identifies a specific psychological dynamic: power that does not announce itself is more threatening to those who observe it than power that does — because the observer's inability to categorise, predict, or define the subject activates the documented 'uncertainty effect.' In Dr. McLean's archive, this proposition is not metaphor. The archive's 2,304 blockchain-verified primary-source documents were assembled across 35 years without institutional announcement, without media campaign, without legal advocacy, and without the standard infrastructure of a visible whistleblower operation. The archive simply appeared — on a publicly accessible website, blockchain-verified, internationally distributed to 1,100,000+ downloads across six continents — without a single press release, public relations professional, or institutional intermediary. The institutional apparatus that had deployed ASIO operative co-tenancy, 14 involuntary hospitalisations, pharmacological assault confirmed on ATO letterhead, a death threat, 350+ identity fraud registrations, and $32.9M in suppressed entitlements spent 35 years attempting to suppress a subject who never announced what they were building. When the archive appeared, it appeared complete. Power that does not announce itself grows in silence. The archive is what happens when silence is not capitulation — it is construction.",

They used to think they could read you. Now your silence feels like a threat.",
    proposition: "The video identifies the uncertainty effect — the documented phenomenon in which the human brain becomes stressed when it cannot predict someone's next move. In Dr. McLean's archive, the documented institutional behaviour pattern is precisely consistent with the stress response of systems unable to predict a subject they cannot define. The 25+ agency circular referral system is not a bureaucratic response to a well-understood actor. It is a documented stress response to an actor who could not be categorised within standard institutional frameworks. You cannot weaponise a psychiatric label against someone who responds by citing primary-source government documents. You cannot predict an actor who documents every move. You cannot neutralise a complaint submitted to 25+ institutions, the ICC, and the UNHCR simultaneously. The archive is the glitch in their control system — not because it is disruptive, but because it operates according to a logic the institutional control system does not recognise: documentation as power, primary-source evidence as the only currency, and silence as the archive's operational mode.",

In Dr. McLean's archive, the institutional system that deployed against the subject was not just unable to solve the subject — it documented its own failure in the process. Every institutional actor who attempted to categorise the subject as delusional, unstable, or inconsequential generated primary-source correspondence that became an exhibit in the ICC archive. 17+ institutional bodies that coordinated refusal — each produced letterhead confirming the refusal. The ATO produced government correspondence confirming the drugging it was meant to suppress the record of. The clinical system produced 14 hospitalisations that became 14 ICC exhibits.
