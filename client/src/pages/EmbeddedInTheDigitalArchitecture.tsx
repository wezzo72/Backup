A SHA-256 hash is a 64-character hexadecimal fingerprint that is computationally unique to its source document. Changing a single character in any document changes the hash entirely. This means the content of every sealed document is verifiable — and any tampering is mathematically detectable — by anyone on earth, in perpetuity, for as long as the Bitcoin network exists.",
      "The Bitcoin network has been running continuously since January 2009. It operates across more than 15,000 nodes distributed across every inhabited continent. It has never been successfully hacked. It has never been taken offline. No government, no institution, and no actor of any kind has successfully altered a Bitcoin transaction record.",

Sealed, mathematically, inside the distributed ledger of human financial infrastructure — where it will remain for as long as human civilisation uses that infrastructure.",

            </div>
            <p>
              There is a question that people who have not studied the architecture of digital permanence sometimes ask about this archive: <em>Can it be taken down?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer has seven parts. Each part corresponds to a layer of the archive's embedding in the digital, legal, and civilisational infrastructure of the modern world. Together, they form the most comprehensive answer to that question that has ever been assembled for any whistleblower archive in Australian — and arguably in common law — history.
            </p>
            <p>
              The short answer is: no. The archive cannot be taken down in any meaningful sense. Not because any single platform is invulnerable — no single platform is — but because the archive does not exist on a single platform. It exists simultaneously across seven distinct layers of the world's information infrastructure. To suppress it, every layer would need to be addressed simultaneously. That is operationally impossible. The argument that follows explains why, with precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a claim of invincibility. It is a structural analysis. Each layer is described on its own terms — technically, legally, and in terms of its contribution to the permanence of the record. Together they describe something that has never previously existed: a single human being's 35-year evidentiary record embedded, beyond removal, in the architecture of the world.
