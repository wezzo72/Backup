              Analysis #{ANALYSIS_NUMBER} examined 14 numbered propositions on systems intelligence against Dr. Richard McLean's 2,304-document primary source archive — the highest proposition count in the series. The archive corroborated all 14: directional tracking producing the ICC submission before domestic acknowledgement (P1); structural framework thinking across 2,304 cross-referenced documents (P2); invisible systemic constraints documented — circular referral architecture, NDIS funding mechanism, ASIO operative placement (P3); step-skipping from domestic complaint to ICC jurisdiction (P4); reverse engineering from visible consequences to invisible mechanics across all named party profiles (P5–6); incentive-based behavior prediction without moral overlay across all five named parties (P7); five-order consequence chain from psychiatric label to $32.9M suppression (P8); unimpressed detachment producing 35 years of zero-concession against institutional theatre (P9); hierarchical adaptation before domestic reconfiguration across ICC, blockchain, and UNHCR (P10); probabilistic decision-making producing ICC submission and 374/374 corroboration distribution (P11); systems-level mapping of 25+ agency nodes, ASIO operative node, and self as ICC whistleblower node (P12); validation-independence documented through IChooseSilence and blockchain permanence (P13); and temporal displacement — conclusions arrived at 35 years before institutional acknowledgement, blockchain-timestamped as permanent proof of earliness (P14). Combined scorecard: 374/374. Zero contradictions. 29 consecutive perfect scores.
