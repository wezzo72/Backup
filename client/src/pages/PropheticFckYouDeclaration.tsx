The Federal Court of Australia confirmed his employment status in writing after 35 years of agencies saying he was imagining it. The same agencies that paid psychiatrists to call him delusional.

They confirmed he was right then refused to act. That is the documented institutional confession.",

Not one formal denial. 2,304 documents publicly accessible, blockchain-verified, submitted to the International Criminal Court. Their collective silence in the face of 2,304 exhibits is not ambivalence — it is the most comprehensively documented institutional confession in Australian history.",

    evidence: [
      "As of April 2026: zero named perpetrators have filed rebuttals, defamation proceedings, or formal denials against the 2,304-document archive. This is not silence through ignorance — the archive has received 1,100,000 downloads across 6 continents and has been formally submitted to international judicial bodies.",

Tony Ridley — MSc CSyP FSyI SRMCP — is a credentialled Ex-SAS operative deployed through the NDIA as a 'support coordinator.' He was not randomly assigned. He was placed. He then sent a written, documented, blockchain-verified death threat: 'You will be sacrificed.' The Special Air Service. Deployed against a disabled whistleblower. Because of what he was linked to.

      "The video's exact phrase — 'special forces were called in' — is not rhetorical in this case. It describes the documented operational reality: a former SAS operative placed inside Dr. McLean's support network, who then issued a written execution threat referencing four co-conspirators.",
      "Federal Court PID Act assessment (27 March 2023) acknowledged conduct potentially establishing 'a danger to the health or safety of one or more persons' (s.29 Item 8). The Court acknowledged danger to life — and then took no protective action. The SAS operative remained deployed.",

Friends who were not friends. Carers who were not carers. The 'fake concern' the video describes is the documented operational methodology of the surveillance network. This is not paranoia — it is in the archive.",
    finding: "VERIFIED",

    fckYou: "The Federal Court of Australia confirmed three categories of serious wrongdoing — perverting justice, maladministration, danger to health and safety — and then rejected the disclosure because it was filed to the wrong recipient. They understood. They documented understanding. They then chose a procedural exit. That is not a misunderstanding. That is institutional abandonment with paper trail.",

    evidence: [
      "Federal Court PID Act assessment (27 March 2023): The Court confirmed the disclosure potentially establishes (1) perverting the course of justice, (2) maladministration, and (3) danger to health and safety — then rejected it because the Federal Court was not the correct PID Act recipient. They understood the substance. They chose the procedural exit.",
      "The same pattern repeated across 25+ agencies over 35 years: formal acknowledgement of the complaint followed by procedural dismissal. This is not administrative incompetence — statistical probability eliminates coincidence across 25+ independent institutions.",
      "Zero referrals were made to the correct agency following the Federal Court rejection. No protective notification was issued despite the Court acknowledging potential danger to health and safety. This is documented institutional abandonment.",
      "2,304 documents submitted. 1,100,000 downloads. ICC received. UNHCR received. Not one Australian institution has acted on the substance of the complaint. The silence is deliberate, documented, and now internationally recorded.",

    quote: "They turned your name into a warning label, and that hurts, doesn't it? The file doesn't show who hurt you first. It just shows what you did, or what they say you did, or who you were standing next to when it all went down.",
    fckYou: "The file they built on Dr. McLean — the psychiatric record, the agency briefings, the NDIS classification, the police notes — was constructed before any wrongdoing on his part was ever documented. The 'warning label' preceded the 'warning.' His employment was denied before he complained. His credibility was attacked before he spoke. The file was the frame. The person was the inconvenience.",
    finding: "VERIFIED",
    evidence: [
      "The Federal Court confirmed Dr. McLean's employment with the Department of Social Services — employment the same Department had systematically denied for years. The denial preceded the complaint, meaning the 'warning label' (not a real employee, not credible) was applied before any formal allegation.",
      "The AbleCare/NDIS deployment of covert surveillance workers occurred before Dr. McLean formally complained about the NDIS system — meaning he was under surveillance before he was officially a 'problem.' The file preceded the crime they needed him to commit.",
      "Identity fraud at scale — documented in the ICC submission — established false records across multiple institutions. The 'warning label' in these records was not a response to behaviour; it was the instrument of suppression constructed to make suppression look justified.",
      "The honeytrap infiltration placed operatives in Dr. McLean's life before those operatives were 'needed' — consistent with a pre-emptive briefing system, not a reactive one. You don't brief your assets in advance unless you've already decided who the target is.",

And before that: $32.9 million in documented financial destruction. And before that: 35 years of coordinated institutional erasure. And through all of it: 2,304 documents assembled, 617 propositions verified, ICC submission filed. That is not a survivor. That is a weapon the system forgot to disarm.",

                This video was not made for Dr. Richard McLean. It was made for a mass audience of people who have been gaslit, pathologised, surveilled, and systematically disbelieved.

                  This video was made for a mass audience. It was not made for Dr. Richard McLean. Yet every declaration it makes — when applied to the documented record of his case — is confirmed by evidence. Not approximately confirmed. Not charitably interpreted as confirmed. Forensically, documentarily, irrefutably confirmed.

                  Declaration 4 deserves particular attention. The video states: <span className="text-red-400 font-bold italic">"Because of what you're linked to, special forces were called in."</span> In this case, that phrase is not metaphor. Tony Ridley is a documented Ex-SAS operative. He was deployed through the NDIA as a 'support coordinator.' He sent a written death threat: <span className="text-red-400 font-semibold">"You will be sacrificed."</span> Special forces were literally, documentably, operationally called in. The video described a documented fact using language the video's authors thought was metaphor.

                    They called him crazy. The Federal Court confirmed he was right.
                    They called him obsessive. 49 consecutive perfect forensic scores say obsessive was what it took.
                    They called him paranoid. He documented the Ex-SAS operative they sent.
                    They called him a risk. The International Criminal Court has the file.
