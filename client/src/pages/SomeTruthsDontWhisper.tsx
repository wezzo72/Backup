    proposition: "The video's ninth proposition identifies light-dimming as the specific institutional and relational response to the target's increasing self-clarity — that labels like 'too much', 'too intense', and 'too sensitive' are deployed not in response to genuine dysregulation but in response to boundary-setting that threatens the control architecture. In Dr. McLean's archive, this is documented across both the relational record (family members, intimate partner) and the institutional record (psychiatric system applying labels when complaints approach institutional accountability).",
