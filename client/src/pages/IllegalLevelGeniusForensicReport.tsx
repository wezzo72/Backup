The ATO pharmacological assault letter is the institution mathematically balancing its own position against a witness they could not refute. But the archive's counter-equation is absolute: 603/603 propositions verified across 56 independent forensic analyses with zero contradictions. The institutions rounded the brilliance down. The archive rounded it back up — to the highest international jurisdiction. Numbers do not lie. The ICC's formal Article 7 receipt is the proof.",
