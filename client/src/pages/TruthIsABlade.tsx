    proposition: "The video's second numbered proposition describes the act of naming — not accusing with emotion, but identifying with precision — as the mechanism by which institutional illusions collapse. The archive's documentation practice is precisely this: Dr. McLean named the coordination pattern, named the institutional actors, named the mechanism (circular referral), named the financial suppression instruments, named the clinical weaponisation strategy. The naming was not dramatic. It was forensic. And the archive confirms the video's claim: naming what is hidden in institutional structures removes its operational power.",

This was not alleging clinical negligence. It was naming the pattern: 14 hospitalisations, each occurring in proximity to disclosure events, each terminating the disclosure cycle, each producing institutional records that Dr. McLean then documented as exhibits.

The archive confirms: the coordination illusion was destroyed by naming the pattern (template language across eight agencies); the clinical suppression illusion was destroyed by naming the timing (hospitalisations at disclosure intervals); the individual label illusion was destroyed by the clinical system's own mirror (Lagasse discharge notes).

                  This analysis applies the same methodology used across all 29 analyses in this series. Each proposition is extracted verbatim from the video transcript. It is then tested against primary source documents in Dr. McLean's archive — clinical records, government correspondence, court documents, ASIC registrations, blockchain timestamps, and ICC/UNHCR submission receipts. A proposition is marked CORROBORATED only when the archive contains primary source evidence that independently confirms it. A proposition is marked CONTRADICTED if archive evidence contradicts it. The methodology does not favour the subject's preferred conclusion.
