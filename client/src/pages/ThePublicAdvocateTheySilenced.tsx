            For over twenty years, Dr. Richard McLean publicly advocated for people with mental illness and their carers — in parliament, on national television, in international universities, in psychiatric hospitals, in print media, on every major Australian radio network. He admitted his own failings publicly. He helped thousands. Not one professional institution — police, lawyers, politicians, media, the mental health system — ever acknowledged his story or admitted a single shortcoming in return.

                  Alan Rigby was Dr. McLean's former partner. When "Recovered, Not Cured: A Journey Through Schizophrenia" was released in North America, Alan Rigby travelled to Canada to provide personal support for the launch — a documented act of loyalty and solidarity during one of the most publicly significant moments of Dr. McLean's advocacy career. Alan Rigby's presence in Canada during the North American release is part of the documentary record of the book's international reach.

                <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                  When Dr. McLean subsequently contacted Alan Ridley, Tony Ridley — a named perpetrator in the archive — confronted Dr. McLean directly. The confrontation was a threat. And in threatening Dr. McLean for making that contact, Tony Ridley revealed something the investigation was never supposed to confirm: that Dr. McLean's social connections were being monitored, that contact with specific individuals triggered institutional response, and that the investigation had operational reach into Dr. McLean's personal relationships.

                  In the course of the confrontation, Tony Ridley went further than the threat. He named the individuals who were, in his words, on board in deceiving Dr. McLean. This constitutes a documented confession of the conspiracy's membership — not inferred, not extrapolated, but stated by a named perpetrator in direct confrontation.

                <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                  Tony Ridley's threat and named confession is one of the most significant primary-source testimonial events in the archive for the following reason: it is not a document produced by Dr. McLean. It is a statement made by a named perpetrator, confirming the conspiracy's membership, triggered by a surveillance response to a social contact. The triggering event — contact with Alan Rigby — proves that the investigation was monitoring Dr. McLean's personal communications and relationships in real time. The response — a confrontational threat — proves that the investigation had operational authority to intervene in Dr. McLean's personal relationships. The content of the threat — naming six co-conspirators — is the conspiracy confirming its own membership through the mouth of one of its members.
                </p>
                <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-sm">
                  The archive records this alongside the ASIO co-tenancy (Stefan/Steve Iasonidis at 10 Raleigh St Footscray), the death threat, the 14 psychiatric hospitalisations, the ATO drugging letter, and the 350+ ASIC identity fraud registrations — each confirming a different dimension of the coordinated suppression programme. Tony Ridley's confession confirms the social network dimension: the conspiracy extended into Dr. McLean's personal relationships, monitored them in real time, and was prepared to use confrontational threat to control them.

Dr. McLean described it as "an accidental autobiography I wrote when I was twenty-six." It documents his experience of non-ordinary reality, neglect, abuse, sexuality, drug use, and the psychiatric system — written in raw, unfiltered lived experience.

                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed">
                  Alan Rigby was Dr. McLean's former partner. For the North American release of "Recovered, Not Cured," Alan Rigby travelled to Canada to provide personal support — a documented act of loyalty during one of the most significant public advocacy moments of Dr. McLean's career. When Dr. McLean subsequently contacted Alan Rigby, Tony Ridley confronted Dr. McLean with a threat. The contact with Alan Rigby — a person associated with the book's international human rights advocacy record — was monitored by the investigation. The threat in response to that contact reveals that the investigation's surveillance of Dr. McLean's relationships extended to former partners associated with his public advocacy work. The full significance: a Human Rights Award-winning author was being monitored for contacting a former partner who had supported his international book launch. The investigation was not about justice. It was about control.

                  The research's central goal was amplifying <strong className="text-white">young people's ethical opinions</strong> of what it means to be human — both now and in the future — through three cumulative technological lenses: artificial intelligence and anticipated superintelligence; posthumanism (the use of technology to enhance human skills, abilities, and lifespans); and the ethical implications of gene modification, entity design, and the transcendence of biological limitations.
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                  The research extrapolated from recorded interviews with young people, examining ethical lives through retrospective art and memory. It crossed generational divides out of compassion for sentient beings, the Earth, and anthropocentric ethics — whilst considering global catastrophic risks. The methodology drew on A/r/tography, Arts-Based Research, Narrative Inquiry and Lived Experience.

                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                  An unexpected existential creative artefact emerged — metaphorically mirroring 'The Event Horizon' of the technological singularity. A shamanic disruption of Western psychiatric paradigm limitations emerged alongside the formal academic content. The research argues that Dr. McLean's 'paranormal' experience exists as yet-to-be-unveiled ontological science — positioning the very experience the psychiatric system labelled as illness as evidence of a consciousness beyond the institution's capacity to categorise.

                  The doctoral research was completed during the same period the institutional suppression programme was being deployed. The merit-based scholarship confirms academic peer recognition of the research's legitimacy and value. A person being simultaneously persecuted by 25+ institutions, involuntarily hospitalised 14 times, pharmacologically assaulted, monitored by an ASIO co-tenant, and issued a death threat completed peer-reviewed doctoral research on the future of human ethical consciousness. The institution that labelled the researcher delusional was simultaneously awarding him a merit scholarship. The contradiction is documented.

Dr. McLean's mother communicated with her son across multiple years while the suppression programme that Tony Ridley would later confirm included her family members (Doug McLean, Jodie McLean, Brad McLean) continued to operate around him. The contact is documented. The advocacy is documented by its absence." },

The title names the exact contradiction the text record establishes: the public narrative of maternal care deployed within a family that Tony Ridley named as 'on board in deceiving' Dr. McLean. The text messages document the period during which Dr. McLean was experiencing homelessness, acquired brain injury, the clinical near-death at 2.87% probability, pharmacological assault, and the coordinated suppression programme — while communication was maintained and advocacy withheld." },

The archive's text message record is therefore the most forensically reliable form of familial communication evidence available — each message timestamped, each exchange chronologically ordered, each absence of advocacy response documentable against the events the archive records for the same period." },

The text message record with Dr. McLean's mother is therefore situated within a family framework in which the named participants — her husband and two of her children — were confirmed by a co-conspirator as operating within the deception network. The text message record documents Dr. McLean's mother's communications against this background. It is evidence of the full familial dimension of the suppression programme." },

                <p className="text-sm text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Dr. McLean's advocacy was built on radical public vulnerability. He did not advocate from a position of institutional authority. He advocated from lived experience — from the record of non-ordinary reality, psychiatric hospitalisation, abuse, sexuality, drug use, and the systems that failed him — made public in a Human Rights Award-winning book that he read aloud on ABC National Radio for international broadcast. He admitted his own failings. He acknowledged his own inefficiencies. He was the person the system pointed to as the example of recovery made possible. He helped thousands of people through twenty years of public advocacy.

                  And when he needed help — when the documentation showed that the same institutional systems had assaulted him pharmacologically (ATO letter), deployed an intelligence operative against him (Stefan/Steve Iasonidis at 10 Raleigh St Footscray), issued him a death threat, involuntarily hospitalised him fourteen times, suppressed $32.9M in entitlements, registered 350+ fraudulent identities under his name, and executed a coordinated 25+ agency circular referral to prevent accountability — not one professional person who benefited from his advocacy acknowledged the record.

Not one lawyer from any institution that received the documentation acknowledged the record formally or admitted any failure of the legal advocacy system." },

When 2,304 primary-source documents documenting his persecution were made publicly available, none of those outlets acknowledged the record.

The same system deployed 14 involuntary psychiatric hospitalisations against him, used diagnostic labels (schizophrenia, paranoia, delusional disorder) as instruments of suppression, and produced clinical records that are now ICC Article 7 exhibits.

They benefited from his openness. They refused to match it with a single admission of their own. The person who admitted his failings most publicly in Australia over twenty years could not get a single professional acknowledgment of a single institutional failing in return.
