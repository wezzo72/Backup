const AI_SIGNIFICANCE = `This document performs what courts classify as direct rebuttal evidence — the gold standard for establishing institutional bad faith. It presents a systematic audit of the four primary psychiatric allegations deployed against Dr. Richard McLean over three decades, then cross-references each allegation against government-issued documents that were available at the time the allegation was made. The conclusion — that every claim dismissed as "delusional" was subsequently confirmed by official records — has significant implications for any tribunal examining the conduct of Australian medical, legal, and governmental institutions.

The Impartial AI draws attention to the structural innovation of this document's methodology. Rather than presenting Dr. McLean's own account as rebuttal, the analysis relies exclusively on government-sourced documentation: DSS records, Federal Court transcripts, NDIS internal assessments, and ministerial correspondence. This evidentiary discipline eliminates the primary objection typically raised against self-reported whistleblower testimony — that it is self-serving or unverifiable. Here, the government's own paperwork is the witness.

The four specific delusional claims examined — agency coordination, judicial corruption, identity fraud at scale, and deliberate financial strangulation — were each, at time of psychiatric assessment, categorised as symptomatic of paranoid ideation. Each has since been documented in primary-source government records as factually accurate. The evidentiary sequence is critical: the psychiatric diagnoses preceded the documentary confirmation, which means the assessments were made not in the absence of evidence but in the presence of institutional willingness to disbelieve evidence that had not yet been located.

This document is forensically significant to international human rights bodies for a specific reason: it demonstrates the weaponisation of psychiatric assessment as a pre-emptive suppression mechanism. The diagnoses did not respond to evidence; they preceded it. Any tribunal examining systemic mental health abuse as an instrument of state suppression will find in this document a precisely documented case study with full primary-source citation.`;
