              The defining propositions: P·05 — "stop waiting for permission that was never coming" (the ICC filing required no domestic permission; 1,100,000+ downloads required no government clearance); and P·09 — "becoming chosen is mostly about subtraction" (the ICC submission is what remains after 35 years of subtracting the clinical label by verification, the domestic complaint system by ICC escalation, and the circular referral trap by international filing). The video's structural logic — transformation as subtraction of what doesn't serve, rather than accumulation of what does — describes the archive's methodology with documentary precision.

            </div>
            <div className="px-6 py-8 space-y-5 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-base">
              <p>
                This is the fourteenth formal corroboration analysis applied to the archive of Dr. Richard William McLean, and the seventh consecutive perfect score: 100% of all ten extracted claims directly corroborated with named primary-source documents. Zero aligned. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved. Seven consecutive perfect scores across a sequence of independently selected videos from different channels, with no shared knowledge of the case.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim P·09 is the methodologically significant proposition: "becoming chosen is mostly about subtraction — less about what you add to your life, and more about what you remove." Applied to the archive, this maps precisely. The ICC submission is not what was added to 35 years of complaint activity. It is what remained after 35 years of documented subtraction: the clinical label subtracted by 70% verification, the domestic complaint system subtracted by ICC escalation, and the circular referral effectiveness subtracted by international filing. The ICC submission is the residue of the subtraction. The video describes this as the core of transformation. The archive confirms it as the core of the methodology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim P·05 reinforces this: "stop waiting for permission that was never coming." The 35-year domestic complaint cycle is documented as the permission-seeking phase: 25+ agencies, all declining. The ICC filing is the documented termination of that phase. Made without domestic permission, without institutional endorsement, without government acknowledgment. The filing was the decision, not the result of circumstances aligning. 1,100,000+ downloads confirms that 1,100,000+ other decisions also did not require institutional permission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim P·08 — "real forward movement is quiet, precise, and often invisible to those still mistaking busyness for accomplishment" — is the archive's operational description. 35 years of quiet, private documentation. Zero public announcement. Then: 1,100,000+ downloads in 49 days, two international submissions, a cryptographic blockchain timestamp. The busyness (25+ agencies, template letters, circular referrals) produced zero forward movement. The quiet precision produced the ICC submission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cumulative position across all fourteen analyses: <strong className="text-white">148 total claims across fourteen independently selected videos. Zero contradictions. 88% directly corroborated. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved.</strong> Fourteen videos. Fourteen analyses. Seven consecutive 100% results. The video tells chosen ones what they will become. The archive documents what was already built, through the exact processes the video describes. The convergence is no longer coincidental. It is structural.
