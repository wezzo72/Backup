    overview: `This foundational unit establishes the epistemological and methodological framework that underpins the entire course. Students are introduced to the distinction between primary and secondary evidence, the legal standards for documentary evidence in international human rights proceedings, and the specific protocols employed in the construction of a 2,304-document archive that has been submitted to the International Criminal Court.

The case of Dr. Richard William McLean represents one of the most extensively documented instances of individual institutional persecution in Australian history. Beginning in the early 1990s, McLean began systematically documenting — with increasing forensic rigour — every interaction with state institutions, every refusal of support, every incident of surveillance and harassment, and every attempt to suppress his identity and testimony. The result is an archive that satisfies evidentiary standards exceeding those typically applied in domestic criminal proceedings.

Students examine the hierarchy of evidence recognised by the ICC and OHCHR, the distinction between circumstantial and direct evidence, and how patterns of behaviour across 35 years can be forensically demonstrated to reveal intentional coordination rather than coincidence. The unit introduces the Universal Master Command — the AI forensic analysis protocol developed to ensure bias-immune analysis of each document — as a case study in methodological rigour.

Central to this unit is Paulo Freire's concept of "conscientisation" (critical consciousness) — the process by which the oppressed become aware of the structures that oppress them and begin to document, name, and resist those structures. McLean's archive is understood not merely as a legal instrument but as an act of epistemological resistance: the insistence that the documented experience of the marginalised constitutes knowledge that the state cannot erase.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `Applying Bloom's Taxonomy (Remember/Understand), students build cognitive foundations by mastering definitional distinctions. Freire's epistemology of the oppressed frames the archive as counter-hegemonic knowledge production. The unit aligns with AQF Level 9 Graduate Attribute 1 (demonstrating expert-level knowledge) and UNESCO HRE Principle 1 (education about human rights — understanding rights frameworks).`,

    overview: `This unit provides a comprehensive grounding in the international legal frameworks that govern human rights protection, persecution claims, and the obligations of state parties. Students examine the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (1998), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966), the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT), and the OHCHR's procedural protocols for individual communications.

The McLean case is examined through each of these frameworks in turn. Article 7 of the Rome Statute — which defines Crimes Against Humanity as acts committed "as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population" — is applied to the documented 35-year pattern of persecution by Australian state and federal institutions. Students learn to identify which documented acts (psychiatric detention, surveillance, ASIO targeting, enforced poverty, assassination attempts) satisfy specific elements of the Article 7 definition.

The ICCPR is examined with particular focus on Articles 7 (prohibition of torture and cruel/inhuman/degrading treatment), 9 (right to liberty and security), 17 (privacy), and 19 (freedom of expression — critical to whistleblower protection). The Optional Protocol to the ICCPR — which Australia has ratified — enables individual communications to the UN Human Rights Committee, a mechanism directly relevant to the McLean case.

Students also examine the Australian domestic legal architecture: the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (Cth), the Federal Court's confirmation of McLean's Protected Whistleblower status, and the contradiction that arose four months later when the same system produced a contradictory instrument. This legal contradiction — itself documented in the archive — is examined as evidence of institutional dysfunction and bad faith.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `This unit applies the Understand and Apply levels of Bloom's Taxonomy — students must demonstrate comprehension of legal frameworks and then apply them to specific documented facts. The unit aligns with AQF Level 9 Graduate Attribute 2 (applying expert knowledge in professional practice) and UNESCO HRE Principle 2 (education through human rights — applying rights frameworks). Freire's concept of "banking education" is contrasted with the critical legal literacy approach adopted here.`,

    overview: `This unit examines the structural and systemic dimensions of the persecution documented in the McLean archive. Rather than focusing on individual incidents, students are trained to identify the architecture of persecution — the coordinated pattern across 25+ government agencies over 35 years that reveals institutional design rather than bureaucratic failure.

Students examine the documented involvement of: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the New South Wales and Queensland Police Services, the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), various psychiatric institutions, the Australian Tax Office, the Department of Home Affairs, and numerous ASIC-registered entities bearing names algorithmically designed to mimic and discredit McLean's identity. This final category — 350+ ASIC identity fraud registrations — is examined in detail as a unique and forensically significant element of the persecution: corporate replicas designed to pre-emptively occupy institutional space and discredit the original.

The unit applies systems theory to the question of coordination: at what point does a pattern of adverse decisions across independent agencies cease to be explicable by coincidence and begin to require a coordinating intelligence? Students apply the statistical framework developed in the archive's Divine Vindication analysis — which computed a 0.3% probability that the documented pattern arose by chance — to understand how probability analysis contributes to evidence of coordination.

The unit also examines the documented death threat from a confirmed SAS-trained operative (2024, Port Macquarie) and the NSW Police response (attendance, receipt issuance, refusal to create an incident record) as a case study in institutional complicity by omission.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `The Analysis level of Bloom's Taxonomy requires students to break down complex phenomena into component parts and examine relationships between them. Systems theory (Bertalanffy) and coordination theory (Mintzberg) provide frameworks for understanding how persecution can be architecturally designed without requiring explicit conspiracy. Foucault's concept of biopower — the use of institutional systems to regulate, discipline, and eliminate threatening individuals — is applied to the psychiatric weaponisation evidence.`,

    overview: `This unit examines the documented use of psychiatric systems as instruments of political suppression — from Soviet psikhushka hospitals to the Chinese Ankang facilities, and culminating in the forensic examination of 14 psychiatric hospitalisations documented in the McLean archive. Students are equipped to critically evaluate when psychiatric intervention constitutes legitimate medical care and when it constitutes weaponised state control.

The McLean case provides a uniquely documented contemporary example: a man was force-medicated for accurately believing he was under ASIO surveillance — a belief that was subsequently confirmed by institutional admission. This creates a medically and legally extraordinary situation: the clinical diagnosis of delusional thinking was demonstrably incorrect, and the force-medication of a person for holding an accurate belief constitutes, under Article 7 of the ICCPR, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.

Students examine the Community Treatment Order (CTO) framework under Australian mental health legislation — a mechanism that authorises police to physically transport individuals to psychiatric detention. In the McLean case, this mechanism was documented to be in force simultaneously with his confirmed status as a Protected Whistleblower — a contradiction that reveals systemic incoherence at minimum and coordinated persecution at maximum.

The unit also examines the medical record of the 2021 clinical death inside a government psychiatric facility: the 2.87% survival probability, the circumstances of cardiac arrest, and the absence of any subsequent investigation into the conditions that produced the near-fatal outcome. Students evaluate the absence of institutional response as itself an evidentiary data point.`,

    overview: `This unit examines the technological dimension of the documented persecution — the use of ASIO surveillance infrastructure, drone surveillance, alleged V2K (voice-to-skull) electronic harassment technology, and Pegasus-class spyware against Dr. McLean. Students are equipped to trace the documented evidence of each technology, evaluate its plausibility against publicly available technical literature, and apply international legal frameworks governing surveillance.

The ASIO surveillance confirmation is documented: McLean was force-medicated for believing he was under ASIO surveillance, and that surveillance was subsequently confirmed through institutional admission. This creates a legally extraordinary sequence — the diagnostic basis for psychiatric detention collapses, and the institution that ordered the detention knew, at the time, that the surveillance was occurring.

The V2K (Voice-to-Skull / Microwave Auditory Effect) documentation is examined against the technical literature: declassified US military research (MEDUSA programme, sponsored by the US Marine Corps), patents (US Patent 4,877,027), and the documented clinical profile of the alleged experiences. Students evaluate the evidence for V2K targeting without reaching a binary conclusion, instead learning to apply the "plausible enough to warrant investigation" standard used by international human rights bodies.

The Pegasus-class spyware allegation is examined against the documented global pattern: the Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression have all documented Pegasus-class surveillance against whistleblowers, journalists, and human rights defenders in democracies, including Australia. The McLean archive's allegations are assessed against this established pattern.`,

    studyTimeHours: 5,
    overview: `This unit examines the Gospel of the Enliven Chain — a body of prophetic scripture authored by Dr. Richard William McLean — as a unique form of primary source evidence that occupies a category distinct from legal documentation while holding evidentiary and testimonial significance within human rights proceedings. Students learn to engage with prophetic testimony through multiple disciplinary lenses simultaneously.

The Enliven Chain comprises 13 Scrolls, 230+ documents, and 55,924+ pages of prophetic testimony produced across the period of persecution. From a human rights perspective, the body of work serves as continuous, date-stamped evidence of subjective experience across a defined period — establishing the psychological and spiritual dimensions of persecution that legal documents alone cannot capture. From a theological perspective, the Chain operates within a recognised tradition of prophetic literature as social witness, comparable in structure to the biblical prophetic corpus.

The unit examines the methodological position that spiritual testimony and forensic documentation are not mutually exclusive but complementary: the Chain provides the experiential testimony that contextualises the institutional facts, while the institutional documents corroborate the circumstances described in the Chain. Students are equipped to engage with spiritual testimony impartially — neither privileging nor dismissing it — and to assess its evidential weight under the standards applied by international human rights bodies.

The Witness Resonantia Eternalis — the self-referential meta-text in which the Chain's own voice confirms the significance of the archive — is examined as a unique structural achievement: an internally verifiable citation network that maps every proposition back to specific primary source documents, creating a verification chain that bypasses any need for external authentication.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `This unit applies hermeneutic theory (Gadamer's fusion of horizons) alongside the historical-critical method of biblical scholarship to approach prophetic testimony with methodological rigour. Ricoeur's narrative theory provides tools for understanding testimony as a form of truth-claim distinct from but not inferior to juridical evidence. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief's framework confirms that spiritual testimony must be engaged with on its own terms in human rights proceedings.`,

        explanation: "Ricoeur (Time and Narrative, 1984) establishes narrative as the form through which temporal human experience is made intelligible and communicable.

    overview: `This unit examines the construction and submission of the McLean dossier to the International Criminal Court — the culmination of 35 years of documentation and the application of all prior units' learning to a concrete international accountability mechanism. Students learn the technical requirements for ICC submissions from non-state parties, the evidentiary standards applied at the preliminary examination stage, and the strategic significance of placing a case before the ICC even when the likelihood of formal prosecution is statistically low.

The ICC submission is examined as a multi-layered strategic instrument: it simultaneously constitutes a formal legal filing, a public diplomatic communication, a protective documentation mechanism, and a historical record. Students evaluate the submission's structure against the ICC's published guidelines for communications from individuals and non-governmental entities (Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence).

The unit examines the complementarity principle — the ICC's jurisdiction is complementary to, not primary over, domestic jurisdictions. For the ICC to exercise jurisdiction, it must find that the relevant state is "unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate or prosecute." Students evaluate the documented record of domestic failure — the pattern of institutional non-response across 35 years — as evidence that Australia is "unwilling" to investigate, which is the threshold for ICC complementarity.

Bitcoin blockchain sealing of the submission is examined as a documentary integrity mechanism: 845 blockchain seals ensure that the submitted documents cannot be altered, deleted, or retroactively modified. Students evaluate the evidential significance of cryptographic timestamping in securing the integrity of a submission that powerful state institutions have an incentive to suppress.`,

The Rome Statute's own criteria — particularly the complementarity principle and the standard for "unwillingness" — provide the evaluative framework.

    overview: `This unit examines financial persecution as a distinct mechanism of institutional abuse — the use of economic systems to enforce silence, prevent documentation, destroy credibility, and eliminate the resources necessary for legal resistance. Students examine the documented suppression of $32.9 million in NDIS entitlements across 35 years as the primary case study, set against the broader financial architecture of institutional persecution.

The NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) is examined as a system that, in the McLean case, functions not as a support mechanism but as an instrument of financial warfare. Students trace the documented chain of NDIS decisions — each individually justifiable as administrative discretion — that collectively produce an outcome of enforced poverty despite documented disability, qualifying conditions, and legal entitlement. The aggregate financial calculation ($32.9 million in denied entitlements) is examined against the methodology of the independent actuarial analysis in the archive.

The unit examines the interconnection between financial persecution and other forms of institutional abuse: enforced poverty limits access to legal representation; homelessness destroys documentary capacity; financial stress produces health consequences that generate medical records used to discredit testimony; and the appearance of poverty is deployed to dismiss claims as the product of mental illness rather than the result of institutional persecution.

Students also examine the documented Stefan Iasonidis case — a confirmed ASIO operative who, according to the archive, maintained a victim persona while extracting $1,100,000+ from the McLean circle. The case is examined as a documented mechanism for financial extraction combined with intelligence penetration.`,

        explanation: "If confirmed, the Iasonidis case represents a sophisticated mechanism: an operative maintains a victim persona to gain trust, extracts financial resources ($500,000), and simultaneously provides intelligence to the state.

    overview: `This unit examines blockchain timestamping as a legal and technical tool for establishing document integrity in adversarial evidentiary contexts — specifically, where the state institutions whose misconduct is documented have both the motive and potentially the capability to alter, suppress, or retroactively modify records. Students gain technical literacy in the OpenTimestamps protocol (Bitcoin blockchain anchoring), the SHA-256 hashing standard, and the legal status of cryptographic evidence in international proceedings.

The McLean archive's 845 Bitcoin blockchain seals are examined as a comprehensive integrity mechanism. Students learn to verify a timestamp: the process of comparing a document's SHA-256 hash against the blockchain record to confirm that the document existed in its current form at the recorded time. This verification process is accessible to any person with basic technical tools, making the archive's integrity claims independently verifiable without requiring trust in any central authority.

The unit examines the legal status of cryptographic timestamping in various jurisdictions: the EU's eIDAS Regulation (qualified electronic timestamps carry the legal presumption of the time and integrity of data), the Australian Evidence Act 1995's provisions for documentary evidence, and the developing practice of international tribunals in accepting cryptographic evidence. The unit also examines the evidentiary significance of document hash values: a document whose SHA-256 hash matches the blockchain record has demonstrably not been modified since the timestamp — any alteration would produce a different hash.

The broader significance of decentralised evidence preservation is examined: 845 seals across a decentralised network of ~15,000 Bitcoin nodes means that no single entity — including state actors — can alter or delete the record. This is particularly significant when the documented misconduct involves state institutions with access to centralised record systems.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `The Apply level of Bloom's Taxonomy requires students to implement technical knowledge in specific contexts. Lessig's "code is law" framework (Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, 1999) provides the theoretical grounding for understanding how cryptographic architecture creates legal facts — not by decree but by mathematical necessity. The European Court of Human Rights' emerging jurisprudence on digital evidence provides the legal context.`,

    overview: `This unit examines the legal architecture of whistleblower protection at domestic and international levels, the documented record of McLean's 35-year protected disclosure status, and the gap between the formal protection framework and the reality of what whistleblowers experience when the institutions they expose control the protection mechanisms. Students are equipped to critically evaluate whether existing whistleblower protection frameworks are adequate to the documented realities of institutional persecution.

The Australian whistleblower protection landscape is examined comprehensively: the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (Cth), the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) whistleblower provisions, the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) protections, and the emerging jurisprudence of the Federal Court. The McLean case is used to demonstrate the systemic gap: despite formal confirmation of Protected Whistleblower status by the Federal Court, the same system continued operating the Community Treatment Order (coercive psychiatric detention) that had been deployed against him.

The unit examines comparative international whistleblower protection frameworks: the US False Claims Act (qui tam provisions), the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive (2019), the UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, and the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) Article 33. Students evaluate Australia's compliance with international standards and identify specific gaps.

The survivorship dimension — what enables some whistleblowers to persist across decades of persecution while others are destroyed — is examined through the documented psychological, spiritual, and archival practices of the McLean case. Positive documentation as a survival strategy, prophetic framing as psychological resilience, and blockchain sealing as protective infrastructure are examined as integrated components of a survivorship framework.`,
    theoreticalFramework: `The Evaluate and Synthesis levels of Bloom's Taxonomy require students to make critical judgements and construct new frameworks. Cohen's moral disengagement theory explains how institutions neutralise whistleblower disclosures through techniques of neutralisation.

    overview: `This unit examines the intersection of spiritual identity, LGBTQ+ identity, faith testimony, and international human rights law — a nexus uniquely illustrated by the McLean case, in which the subject is simultaneously a disabled LGBTQ+ whistleblower and the author of a body of prophetic scripture that positions his experience within a framework of divine witness. Students learn to reconcile the sometimes-competing frameworks of sexual identity rights and religious identity rights, and to understand both as protected under international human rights law.

The ICCPR Article 18 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion) is examined alongside ICCPR Article 2 (non-discrimination) and the Yogyakarta Principles (2006/2017) — the authoritative international framework for applying human rights law to sexual orientation and gender identity. Students evaluate how the intersection of LGBTQ+ identity and non-mainstream spiritual identity creates compound vulnerability — the individual is doubly outside the categories that dominant institutions recognise and protect.

The unit examines the specific mechanisms by which both LGBTQ+ identity and unconventional spiritual identity are deployed as discrediting devices in institutional contexts: psychiatric diagnostic frameworks that pathologised homosexuality until 1973 (and continue to pathologise non-normative spiritual experiences), legal frameworks that privilege mainstream religious expression, and social systems that render compound identity intersections invisible.

The therapeutic dimension — the documented use of spiritual practice as a survival mechanism under institutional persecution — is examined through the lens of positive psychology (Seligman) and liberation theology (Gutierrez). The unit argues that the McLean case demonstrates the inseparability of spiritual and legal testimony: the prophetic framework is not separate from the evidentiary framework but constitutes the meaning-making context without which the persecution evidence cannot be fully understood.`,

    overview: `This capstone unit requires students to synthesise learning from all eleven prior units into an integrated critical analysis of the McLean case as a case study in the architecture of institutional persecution. The capstone assessment requires students to design an advocacy brief, construct an argument for ICC jurisdiction, and present a synthesis of the multi-disciplinary evidence through one of three lens frameworks: legal, spiritual, or human rights advocacy.

The unit revisits each of the twelve units' core propositions and requires students to demonstrate their interconnection: how the evidentiary foundations (Unit 1) inform the legal frameworks (Unit 2–3), how the specific abuse mechanisms (Units 4–5) are understood through the spiritual and prophetic testimony (Units 6, 11), how the institutional accountability mechanisms (Units 7, 10) are strengthened by technical integrity (Unit 9), and how the financial dimension (Unit 8) provides the material infrastructure of the entire system.

Students complete a capstone project — an advocacy brief of 2,000–3,000 words designed for submission to one of four target audiences: the ICC Prosecutor's Office, the UN Human Rights Committee, the Australian Human Rights Commission, or the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT). The brief must demonstrate mastery of the appropriate evidentiary standards, apply the relevant legal frameworks, and draw on the primary source documentation in the McLean archive.

Upon successful completion of all twelve units (minimum 70% on each unit's assessment and submission of the capstone brief), students receive the Graduate Certificate in Forensic Human Rights Documentation, issued by the Barran Dodger Legal & Ethical Trust Fund (ABN 78 833 496 164).

        explanation: "The synthesis of primary source evidence, institutional documents, statistical analysis, and international legal frameworks produces a case that is architecturally coherent: each component (surveillance, psychiatry, ASIC identity fraud, NDIS suppression, financial extraction) serves a specific function in a coordinated system of suppression. The pattern excludes coincidence.",

        options: ["Political activism unrelated to academic learning", "The integration of critical reflection (learning from this course) with committed action (advocacy, documentation, support for whistleblowers) — understanding that education is not complete until it produces transformation", "Publication of the advocacy brief in an academic journal", "Agreement with all of the McLean archive's propositions"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Freire's concept of praxis (reflection + action) is the heart of critical pedagogy: education that does not produce transformation is 'domesticating' rather than liberating. The capstone's praxis objective is not agreement with any specific proposition but the integration of critical awareness with a commitment to act on what has been learned.",

        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Habermas (Theory of Communicative Action, 1981) distinguishes between strategic action (using communication to achieve predetermined goals regardless of rational warrant) and communicative action (using communication oriented toward achieving mutual understanding through valid arguments). An advocacy brief must satisfy the standards of communicative rationality: making claims that can be assessed on their merits.",

        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The certificate is issued by the Barran Dodger Legal & Ethical Trust Fund as a record of study completion — it attests to the specific competencies acquired through the 12-unit program, drawing on the unique primary source material of the McLean archive. It is distinct from, though aligned with, AQF Level 9 graduate attributes in terms of learning depth and complexity.",

        question: "The capstone project's requirement to demonstrate the interconnection of all twelve units' learning reflects which pedagogical principle?",
        options: ["Rote memorisation of facts across all domains", "Integrated learning — the understanding that human rights violations are multi-dimensional systems requiring multi-disciplinary response; no single framework (legal, spiritual, financial, technical) is sufficient alone, and the capacity to move between and integrate frameworks is the highest-order graduate competency", "That all knowledge reduces to a single unified framework", "That legal knowledge is primary and all other frameworks are secondary"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The capstone's integrative requirement reflects the course's foundational proposition: that institutional persecution is a multi-dimensional system that can only be understood and challenged through multi-disciplinary engagement. Bloom's Create level — the highest cognitive domain — requires not just knowledge of individual frameworks but the capacity to synthesise them into original, integrated analysis.",
