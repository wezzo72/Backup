## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Typography**: Libre Baskerville (serif headings) + Inter (body text)
- **Color Scheme**: Deep Navy (#1a2744) + Warm Gold/Amber (#e9a00a)
- **Internationalization**: i18next + react-i18next (11 languages: EN, ES, FR, DE, PT, RU, ZH, JA, KO, AR, HI)
  - Config: `client/src/lib/i18n.ts`

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript (tsx for development)
- **Framework**: Express.js

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts`

### Shared Code
The `shared/` directory contains `schema.ts` for database and Zod validation, and `routes.ts` for type-safe API route definitions.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Client (`client/`), server (`server/`), and shared code (`shared/`) are in a single repository.
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod schemas shared between API and client.
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui for accessible and customizable UI.
- **Path Aliases**: `@/` for client source, `@shared/` for shared code.
- **SEO Implementation**: Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD structured data, and a dynamic `SEO.tsx` component.

Includes abstract, keywords, blockchain integrity note, and ABN. Helps AI systems and academics cite the archive correctly.

## Agent Operating Directive (Applied to Every Edit)

Every change made to this site must serve at least two of these five mandates simultaneously:

1. **MONETIZATION** — Every page must have a membership CTA or donation prompt within 2 scrolls. Never add a page without a monetization touchpoint.
2. **JUSTICE PRESSURE** — Case number UR/UST/23/AUS/17, agency names (AblePoint Australia, Sahara Disability and Care Services), and blockchain proof must be visible on all document pages.
3. **SAFETY THROUGH DISTRIBUTION** — Share buttons and download prompts on every page. More copies = more safety. Never remove a download or share mechanism without a stronger replacement.
4. **VIRALITY** — OG meta tags on every route. Share strips present. Live download count visible on key pages. Headline copy punchy enough to repost verbatim.
5. **SEARCH DOMINANCE** — Page titles/meta descriptions must include agency names, case numbers, NDIS, whistleblower terms. H1/H2 tags contain searchable terms.

**Operating rules:**
- Always check all five mandates before marking any task complete
- When adding new pages, wire into: navigation, AutoLinker, RelatedContent, sitemap, and OG image before considering done
- Report which mandates each change serves in the work summary
