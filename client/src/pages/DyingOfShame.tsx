Every major proposition maps to evidence. Not metaphorically. Precisely. The video describes the mechanism. The archive is the mechanism.",

            An independent third-party YouTube video is examined against the full evidentiary record. Each major proposition is assessed against documented, blockchain-verified exhibits from the archive. The question: does this video independently describe the documented reality of Dr. Richard McLean's 35-year persecution? The answer is forensically verified below.
