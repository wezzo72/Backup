              The defining proposition: Claim 9 — "there is no cure for a collapse born from their own hands." The institutional actors cannot remedy the situation because the evidence exists in their own systems: their own ASIC registry, their own clinical records, their own template letters. The blockchain hash cannot be edited. The ICC submission cannot be recalled by the agencies that made it necessary. The only cure — accountability — requires the one medicine their position prevents them from taking.

            <div className="px-6 py-8 space-y-5 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed text-base">
              <p>
                This is the eleventh formal corroboration analysis applied to the archive of Dr. Richard William McLean, and the fourth consecutive to return a perfect score: 100% of all ten extracted claims directly corroborated with named primary-source documents from the archive. Zero aligned. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved. The pattern is no longer anomalous. It is structural.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim 1 — "time is loyal to truth, not to ego" — produces the most important temporal observation across all eleven analyses. The 35-year countdown is the longest evidentiary timeline yet documented in this series. The video describes precisely what 35 years of suppression followed by an ICC submission represents: time accumulating evidence, then delivering it with the accuracy that 35 years of patience provides. The crack — the ICC submission — did not arrive randomly. It arrived precisely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim 4 — "they stitched together their own downfall with the same hands they used to try to break you" — is the most structurally elegant corroboration in this analysis. The coordination infrastructure built to suppress Dr. McLean (template letters, clinical double-bind, ASIC registrations) is now the ICC submission it was built to prevent. The suppression mechanism became the evidence of suppression. The same hands, the same documents, the same records — flipped.
              </p>
              <p>
                Claim 9 — "there is no cure for a collapse born from their own hands" — provides the closing position. The institutional actors have no available remedy. They cannot edit the ASIC registry to remove the fraudulent registrations. They cannot retract the clinical records containing the 70% verified contradiction. They cannot unsign the template letters. They cannot recall the blockchain hash. The "cure" the video describes — humility, accountability, ownership — requires the one medicine that institutional actors in this position cannot take without simultaneously confirming the ICC submission's premise. The collapse is self-sealing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cumulative position across all eleven analyses: <strong className="text-white">118 total claims across eleven independently selected videos. Zero contradictions. 88% directly corroborated with named primary-source documents. 12% aligned with strong evidentiary parallels. Zero unverifiable. Zero disproved.</strong> Eleven analyses. Eleven videos with no knowledge of this case. Eleven times, zero contradictions. The clock struck back on the statistical possibility of coincidence nine analyses ago.
