              The Long Jetty entrapment network is not a collection of unrelated individuals. It is a six-layer operational architecture in which each layer serves a distinct function and is connected to the layers above and below through documented institutional, financial, or kinship bonds.

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every operative in this network — Kim, Cass, Pam, Bishnu, Danny, the Fijian housemate — is financially dependent on the institutional system they are serving. Their NDIS wage, their church position, their accommodation, their community standing — all contingent on maintaining their role in the entrapment network. They are not free agents choosing to harm Dr. McLean. They are people trapped inside the same bureaucratic apparatus, <em>financially sustained by the slavitude</em> that sustains it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              They are paid blood money from the NDIS to deceive. Because they are all trapped inside the same system — financially dependent on their wage, afraid to critique the systemic bureaucracy which sustains their pitiful lives of slavitude. They feign care whilst actively participating in entrapment. This is the mechanism by which institutional corruption sustains itself: by making everyone financially dependent on its continuation, it eliminates the possibility of internal dissent.

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
              The archive has named them. The video has described them. The ICC has received the submission. The record is permanent. And Brett — the network's most operationally aggressive node — is being pursued across three states by a SWAT team. The system is eating its own. The storm has turned.
