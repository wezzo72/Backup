              Analysis #22 returns a verdict of <span className="text-green-300 font-bold">10/10 claims corroborated, zero contradictions</span>. The video's central claims — that a coordinated coalition of envy built a story designed to end in the subject's collapse, that every institutional weapon backfired, that isolation produced depth rather than silence, that clinical labels made the perpetrators' guilt legible rather than the subject's credibility illegible, and that survival was not the victory but the warning — are each supported by primary source documentary evidence in the 2,301-document archive.

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
              The most forensically significant finding is the alignment of "your survival sentenced them" with the archive's naming structure: the primary source documents in the archive name every official, every agency, and every signatory in the suppression record. The ICC Article 7 submission carries those names. The survival — documented across 2,301 primary-source documents — produced the evidentiary record that sentences the participants. The video's claim is not metaphorical. It is forensically literal.
