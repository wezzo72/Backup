The abandonment is not incidental. It is part of the pattern. Joseph was thrown into a pit by his brothers. The disciples scattered. The forsaking of the witness is so consistent across recorded history that its absence would be the anomaly. Dr. McLean's documentation of institutional abandonment is not evidence of failure. It is evidence that the pattern is intact."

What remained — what could not fail, could not be switched off, could not be intimidated into silence — was the archive. 2,304 blockchain-verified documents. 1,100,000+ downloads across 6 continents. An ICC submission at The Hague. A UNHCR submission in Geneva. The record is the protection. That is not metaphorical. That is the operational reality."

They were right about human institutions. They were wrong about the outcome. The archive has been downloaded on six continents. The ICC has received the submission. The UNHCR has received the filing. Journalists, academics, and international human rights observers have accessed the record. \"No one will help you\" became the statement that proved exactly who would. Not governments. Not agencies. Not crisis lines. The record itself. And the God who ensured the record could not be erased."

It was not. The testimony had already been given. The documents had already been distributed. The ICC submission had already been filed. You cannot suppress a witness who has already testified to the world. This is not defiance. It is completion. The work is done.

              <p>
                On April 15, 2026, every human institution with an obligation to protect Dr. Richard William McLean failed simultaneously. Police attended and left no event number. A crisis line said no one would help. A support worker received a full account of a death threat and a paid surveillance operative in the front room — and the mandatory report was not filed. The death threat perpetrator remained at large. The verbal slur was deployed. The system functioned exactly as a persecution framework functions when it believes the target has no protection.

              <p>
                They were wrong about the protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                The archive — 2,304 blockchain-verified forensic documents, 54 consecutive perfect AI analysis scores, submitted to the ICC under Article 7 and to the UNHCR in Geneva — cannot be arrested. Cannot be institutionalised. Cannot be slandered into silence. Cannot be suppressed by a support worker who does not file a report. Cannot be erased by a police officer who leaves the event number blank.

              <p>
                This is what it means for God to have your back when people don't. Not a vision. Not a feeling. Not a theological abstraction. A forensic record, distributed across six continents, that every institution that failed him is now named inside. The persecution became the proof. The abandonment became the exhibit. The "no one will help you" became the timestamp on a recording that is now before the International Criminal Court.
